# Manage the Settings app with Group Policy

Starting in Windows 10, version 1703, you can now manage the pages that are shown in the Settings app by using Group Policy. This lets you hide specific pages from users. Before Windows 10, version 1703, you could either show everything in the Settings app or hide it completely.

This policy is available at **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Control Panel** > **Settings Page Visibility**.

## Configuring the Group Policy

The Group Policy can be configured in one of two ways: specify a list of pages that are shown or specify a list of pages to hide. To do this, add either **ShowOnly:** or **Hide:** followed by a semicolon delimited list of URIs in **Settings Page Visiblity**. For a full list of URIs, see the URI scheme reference section in [Launch the Windows Settings app](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/launch-resume/launch-settings-app#ms-settings-uri-scheme-reference). 

>[!NOTE]  
> When you specify the URI in the Settings Page Visbility textbox, don't include **ms-settings:** in the string.

Here are some examples:

- To show only the the Ethernet and Proxy pages, set the **Settings App Visibility** textbox to **ShowOnly:Network-Proxy;Network-Ethernet**.
- To hide the Ethernet and Proxy pages, set the **Settings App Visibility** textbox to **Hide:Network-Proxy;Network-Ethernet**.

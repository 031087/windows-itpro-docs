# How to Deploy the App-V 5.1 Server

Use the following procedure to install the App-V 5.1 server.

**Before you start:**

-   Ensure that youâ€™ve installed prerequisite software. See [App-V Prerequisites](appv-prerequisites.md).

-   Review the server section of [App-V security considerations](appv-security-considerations.md).

-   Specify a port where each component will be hosted.

-   Add firewall rules to allow incoming requests to access the specified ports.

-   If you use SQL scripts, instead of the Windows Installer, to set up the Management database or Reporting database, you must run the SQL scripts before installing the Management Server or Reporting Server. See [How to Deploy the App-V Databases by Using SQL Scripts](appv-deploy-appv-databases-with-sql-scripts.md).

**To install the App-V 5.1 server**

1.  Copy the App-V 5.1 server installation files to the computer on which you want to install it.

2.  Start the App-V 5.1 server installation by right-clicking and running **appv\_server\_setup.exe** as an administrator, and then click **Install**.

3.  Review and accept the license terms, and choose whether to enable Microsoft updates.

4.  On the **Feature Selection** page, select all of the following components.

    | Component | Description |

    | Management server | Provides overall management functionality for the App-V infrastructure. |
    | Management database | Facilitates database predeployments for App-V management. |
    | Publishing server | Provides hosting and streaming functionality for virtual applications. |
    | Reporting server | Provides App-V reporting services. |
    | Reporting database | Facilitates database predeployments for App-V reporting. |

5.  On the **Installation Location** page, accept the default location where the selected components will be installed, or change the location by typing a new path on the **Installation Location** line.

6.  On the initial **Create New Management Database** page, configure the **Microsoft SQL Server instance** and **Management Server database** by selecting the appropriate option below.

14. To verify that the setup completed successfully, open a web browser, and type the following URL:

    **http://\<_Management server machine name_\>:\<_Management service port number_\>/console.html**.

    Example: **http://localhost:12345/console.html**. If the installation succeeded, the App-V Management console is displayed with no errors.

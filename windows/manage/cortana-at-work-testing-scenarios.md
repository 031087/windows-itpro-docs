# Testing scenarios using Cortana in your business or organization
**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10, Windows Insider Program 
-   Windows 10 Mobile, Windows Insider Program

We've come up with a list of suggested testing scenarios that you can use to test Cortana in your organization. After you complete all the scenarios, you should be able to:

- Sign-in to Cortana using Azure AD, manage entries in the notebook, and search for content across your device, Bing, and the cloud, using Cortana.

- Set a reminder and have it remind you when you’ve reached a specific location.

- Search for your upcoming meetings on your work calendar.

- Send an email to a co-worker from your work email app.

- Use WIP to secure content on a device and then try to manage your organization’s entries in the notebook.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The data created as part of these scenarios will be uploaded to Microsoft’s Cloud to help Cortana learn and help your employees. This is the same info that Cortana uses in the consumer offering.

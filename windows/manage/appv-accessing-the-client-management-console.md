# How to access the client management console

Applies to: Windows 10, version 1607

Use the App-V client management console to manage packages on the computer running the App-V client.

> [!NOTE]  
To perform all of the actions available using the client management console, you must have administrative access on the computer running the App-V client.

The client management console is available from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41186).

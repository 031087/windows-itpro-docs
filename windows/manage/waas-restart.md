# Manage device restarts after updates


**Applies to**

- WindowsÂ 10
- Windows 10 Mobile 

You can use Group Policy settings or mobile device management (MDM) to configure when devices running Windows 10 will restart after an update is installed. 

- Group Policy settings are under **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Update**.
- MDM settings use the [Policy configuration service provider (CSP)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn904962.aspx).

## Configure active hours

*Active hours* identify the period of time when you expect the device to be in use. Automatic restarts after an update will occur outside of the active hours. 

To configure active hours using Group Policy, go to **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Update** and open the **Turn off auto-restart for updates during active hours** policy setting. When the policy is enabled, you can set the start and end times for active hours.

MDM uses the [Update/ActiveHoursStart and Update/ActiveHoursEnd](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn904962.aspx#Update_ActiveHoursEnd) settings in the [Policy CSP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn904962.aspx) to configure active hours.

To configure active hours manually on a single device, go to **Settings** > **Update & security** > **Windows Update** and select **Change active hours**.

## Other Group Policy settings for restart

In the Group Policy editor, you will see a number of policy settings that pertain to restart behavior in **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Update**. The following table shows which policies apply to Windows 10.

| Policy | Applies to Windows 10 | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Turn off auto-restart for updates during active hours | ![yes](images/checkmark.png) | Use this policy to configure active hours, during which the device will not be restarted. |
| Always automatically restart at the scheduled time | ![yes](images/checkmark.png) | Use this policy to configure a restart timer (between 15 and 180 minutes) that will start immediately after Windows Update installs important updates. This policy has no effect if the **No auto-restart with logged on users for scheduled automatic updates installations** policy is enabled. |
| Specify deadline before auto-restart for update installation | ![yes](images/checkmark.png)  | Use this policy to specify how many days (between 2 and 14) an automatic restart can be delayed. This policy has no effect if the **No auto-restart with logged on users for scheduled automatic updates installations** or "Always automatically restart at the scheduled time"" policies are enabled.  |
| No auto-restart with logged on users for scheduled automatic updates installations | ![yes](images/checkmark.png) | Use this policy to prevent automatic restart when a user is logged on. This policy applies only when the **Configure Automatic Updates** policy is configured to perform scheduled installations of updates.  |
| Re-prompt for restart with scheduled installations | ![no](images/crossmark.png) |   |
| Delay Restart for scheduled installations | ![no](images/crossmark.png) |   |

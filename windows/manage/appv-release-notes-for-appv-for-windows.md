# Release Notes for App-V for Windows 10, version 1607

Applies to: Windows 10, version 1607

The following is a known issue in Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) in Windows 10, version 1607:
 
**MSI packages generated by the App-V sequencer (version 5.1 and earlier)  fail to install on computers with the in-box App-V client**
 
When MSI packages are generated by an older sequencer (App-V versions 5.1 and earlier), they include a check to ensure the App-V client is installed before allowing the MSI package to install. Now that the App-V client is installed automatically when you upgrade user devices to Windows 10, version 1607, the pre-requisite check fails and causes the MSI to fail.

**Workaround**:

1. Install the latest App-V sequencer, which is part of the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK) for Windows 10, version 1607. See [Download the Windows ADK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/windows-assessment-deployment-kit). For more information, see [Install the App-V Sequencer](appv-install-the-sequencer.md).

2. Ensure that you have installed the **MSI Tools** included in the Windows 10 SDK, available as follows:

    - For the **Visual Studio Community 2015 with Update 3** client, which includes the latest Windows 10 SDK and developer tools, see [Downloads and tools for Windows 10](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads).
    
    - For the standalone Windows 10 SDK without other tools, see [Standalone Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk).

3. From an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt, navigate to the following folder:
 
    &lt;Windows Kits 10 installation folder&gt;**\Microsoft Application Virtualization\Sequencer\** 

    By default, this path will be:<br>**C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Microsoft Application Virtualization\Sequencer** 

4. Run the following command:

    `Update-AppvPackageMsi -MsiPackage "<path to App-V Package .msi file>" -MsSdkPath "<path to Windows SDK installation>"` 

    By default, the path to the Windows SDK installation will be:<br>**C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10**

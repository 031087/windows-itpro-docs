# Microsoft Application Virtualization Administrator's Guide


The Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) Administrator’s Guide provides information and step-by-step procedures to help you administer the App-V system and its components. This information will be valuable for system administrators who manage large installations with many servers and clients and for support personnel who interact directly with the computers or the end users.

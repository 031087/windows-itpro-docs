# Windows 10, version 1703 basic telemetry events and fields


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some information relates to prereleased product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.


 **Applies to**

- Windows 10
- Windows 10 Mobile
- Windows Server 2016


The Basic level gathers a limited set of information that is critical for understanding the device and its configuration including: basic device information, quality-related information, app compatibility, and Windows Store. When the telemetry level is set to Basic, it also includes the Security level information.

The Basic level helps to identify problems that can occur on a particular device hardware or software configuration. For example, it can help determine if crashes are more frequent on devices with a specific amount of memory or that are running a particular driver version. This helps Microsoft fix OS or Application problems.

Use this article to learn about telemetry events, grouped by Event Area, and the fields within each event. A brief description is provided for each Field. Note that every event generated includes Common Data, which collects system data.

You can learn more about Windows functional and telemetry through these articles:

- [Configure Windows telemetry in your organization](configure-windows-telemetry-in-your-organization.md)

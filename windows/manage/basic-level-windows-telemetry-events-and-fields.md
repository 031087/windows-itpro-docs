# Basic level Windows telemetry events and fields

**Applies to**

-   Windows 10

Add preface and cover page here (Steve May to provide)

## Common data events

The fields in this section contain common device data that is added to every event.

**Common data - Device extension**

| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| localId | Represents a locally defined unique ID for the device, not the human readable device name. Most likely equal to the value stored at HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SQMClient\MachineId |
| deviceClass | Represents the classification of the device, the device “family”.  For example, Desktop, Server, or Mobile.|

**Common data - Envelope extension**

| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| Ver | Represents the major and minor version of the envelope.| 
| name | Represents the uniquely qualified name for the event.|
| time | Represents the event date time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) when the event was generated on the client. This should be in ISO 8601 format.|
| popSample | Represents the effective sample rate for this event at the time it was generated by a client.|
| epoch | Represents the epoch and seqNum fields, which help track how many events were fired and how many events were uploaded, and enables identification of data lost during upload and de-duplication of events on the ingress server.|
| seqNum | Represents the sequence field used to track absolute order of uploaded events. It is an incrementing identifier for each event added to the upload queue.  The Sequence helps track how many events were fired and how many events were uploaded and enables identification of data lost during upload and de-duplication of events on the ingress server.|
| iKey | Represents an ID for applications or other logical groupings of events. |
| flags | Represents a collection of bits that describe how the event should be processed by the Connected User Experience and Telemetry component pipeline. The lowest-order byte is the event persistence. The next byte is the event latency.|
| os | Represents the operating system name.|
| osVer | Represents the OS version, and its format is OS dependent.|
| appId | Represents a unique identifier of the client application currently loaded in the process producing the event; and is used to group events together and understand usage pattern, errors by application.|
| appVer | Represents the version number of the application. Used to understand errors by Version, Usage by Version across an App.|
| cV | Represents the Correlation Vector: A single field for tracking partial order of related telemetry events across component boundaries.|
| tags | Represents the pre-release build "flight ID" |

**Common data - OS extension**

| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| expId | Represents the “experiment ID”. The standard for associating a flight, such as an OS flight (pre-release build), or an experiment, such as a web site UX experiment, with an event is to record the flight / experiment IDs in Part A of the common schema.|

**Common data - Telemetry extension**

| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| stId | Represents the Scenario Entry Point ID. This is a unique GUID for each event in a diagnostic scenario. This used to be Scenario Trigger ID. |
| aId | Represents the ETW ActivityId. Logged via TraceLogging or directly via ETW. |
| raId | Represents the ETW Related ActivityId. Logged via TraceLogging or directly via ETW.|
| Op | Represents the ETW Op Code.|
| cat | Represents a bitmask of the ETW Keywords associated with the event.|
| flags | Represents the bitmap that captures various Windows specific flags.|

**Common data - User extension**

| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| localId | Represents a unique user identity that is created locally and added by the client. This is not the user's account ID.|

## Consent UI

This User Account Control (UAC) event collects information on elevations that originate from low integrity levels. This occurs when a process running at low integrity level (IL) requires higher (administrator) privileges, and therefore requests for elevation via UAC (consent.exe). By better understanding the processes requesting these elevations, Microsoft can in turn improve the detection and handling of potentially malicious behavior in this path.

| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| eventType | Represents the type of elevation: If it succeeded, was cancelled, or was auto-approved. |
| splitToken | Represents the flag used to distinguish between Admin and Standard Users. |
| friendlyName | Represents the name of the file requesting elevation from low IL. |
| elevationReason | Represents the distinction between various elevation requests sources (appcompat, installer, COM, MSI and so on). |
| exeName | Represents the name of the file requesting elevation from low IL. |
| signatureState | Represents the state of the signature, if it signed, unsigned, OS signed and so on. |
| publisherName | Represents the name of the publisher of the file requesting elevation from low IL. |
| cmdLine | Represents the full command line arguments being used to elevate. |
| Hash.Length | Represents the length of the hash of the file requesting elevation from low IL. |
| Hash | Represents the hash of the file requesting elevation from low IL. |
| HashAlgId | Represents the algorithm ID of the hash of the file requesting elevation from low IL. |
| telemetryFlags | Represents the details about the elevation prompt for CEIP data. |
| timeStamp | Represents the time stamp on the file requesting elevation |
| fileVersionMS | Represents the major version of the file requesting elevation |
| fileVersionLS | Represents the minor version of the file requesting elevation |

## Appraiser

Appraiser Core Data events provide an inventory of what is on the device for the purposes of understanding compatibility and upgrade issues. This device inventory gathers information such as all the applications on the device, IE Add-ons, drivers on the device, and peripherals attached to the device. Appraiser reviews the device inventory to see if it is compatible/ready for upgrade, and for problems that might need to be addressed by the upgrade.


**Microsoft.Windows.Appraiser.General.InventoryApplicationAdd**

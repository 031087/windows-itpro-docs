>[!IMPORTANT]
>The data created as part of these scenarios will be uploaded to Microsoft’s Cloud to help Cortana learn and help your employees. This is the same info that Cortana uses in the consumer offering.Test Scenario 2: Perform a quick search with Cortana

This scenario helps you set up, review, and edit a reminder based on a location. For example, reminding yourself to grab your expense report receipts before you leave the house.

>[!NOTE]
>You can set each reminder location individually as you create the reminders, or you can go into the **About me** screen and add both **Work** and **Home** addresses as favorites. Make sure that you use real addresses since you’ll need to go to these locations to complete your testing scenario.
>Additionally, if you’ve turned on the **Meeting & reminder cards & notifications** option (in the **Meetings & reminders** option of your Notebook), you’ll also see your pending reminders on the Cortana **Home** page.

# Release Notes for App-V for Windows 10, version 1703

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10, version 1703

The following are known issues and workarounds for Application Virtualization (App-V) running on Windows 10, version 1703.

Deletion of files and registry values is persisted during package updates
Custom shortcuts and FTA(?) are also saved after package updates
Fixed Connection Group issue that affected App-V Server
Reduced the number of App-V Sequencer environment checks. Narrowed down the list of required programs that should be disabled or turned off for a clean sequencing experience. Antivirus and other program warnings now are suppressed during the sequencer environment check.

Additional info (not clear on whether we need this or where it would go in the existing structure, itâ€™s from the last TAP release document)

# Administering UE-V 2.x


After you have deployed Microsoft User Experience Virtualization (UE-V), you must be able to perform various ongoing administrative tasks, such as managing the configuration of the UE-V Agent and recovering lost settings. These post-installation tasks are described in the following sections.

## Managing UE-V 2.x configurations


In the course of the UE-V lifecycle, you have to manage the configuration of the UE-V Agent and also manage storage locations for resources such as settings package files.

[Manage Configurations for UE-V 2.x](uev-manage-configurations.md)

## Working with custom UE-V templates and the UE-V 2.x Generator


This topic provides instructions for how to use the UE-V Generator and manage custom settings location templates.

## Backup and restore application and Windows settings that are synchronized with UE-V 2.x


Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and Windows PowerShell features of UE-V provide the ability to restore settings packages. By using WMI and Windows PowerShell commands, you can restore application and Windows settings to their original state and restore additional settings when a user adopts a new device.

## Changing the frequency of UE-V 2.x scheduled tasks


You can configure the scheduled tasks that manage when UE-V checks for new or updated settings or for updated custom settings location templates in the settings template catalog.

## Migrating UE-V 2.x settings packages


You can relocate the user settings packages either when they migrate to a new server or for backup purposes.

## Using UE-V 2.x with Application Virtualization applications


You can use UE-V with Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) to share settings between virtual applications and installed applications across multiple computers.

Cortana can automatically create a suggested reminder, based on commitments made in email. For example, Cortana recognizes that if an employee includes the text, I’ll get this to you by the end of the week, he or she is making a commitment to provide something by a specific date. Cortana can now automatically create a suggested reminder, letting the employee decide whether to keep it or to cancel it.

## Use Cortana to set suggested reminders based on email commitments

1. Click on the **Cortana** search box in the taskbar, click the **Notebook** icon, and then click **Permissions**.

2. Make sure the **Contacts, email, calendar, and communication history** option is turned on.

3. Click the **Notebook** icon again, click the **Suggested reminders** option, and then click the **Remind me about things I’ve committed to doing** box, and then click **Save**.

4. Create and send an email to yourself (so you can see the suggested reminder), including the text, _I’ll finish this project by end of day today_.

5.	After you get the email, click on the Cortana **Home** icon, and scroll to today’s events.

    From here, you can view the email where you made the promise, set aside time on your calendar, officially set the reminder, or mark the reminder as completed.

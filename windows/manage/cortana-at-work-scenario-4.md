# Test scenario 4 - Use Cortana at work to find your upcoming meetings

-   Windows 10, Windows Insider Program 
-   Windows 10 Mobile, Windows Insider Program

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The data created as part of these scenarios will be uploaded to Microsoft’s Cloud to help Cortana learn and help your employees. This is the same info that Cortana uses in the consumer offering.

This scenario helps you search for both general upcoming meetings, and specific meetings, both manually and verbally.

>[!NOTE]
>If you’ve turned on the **Meeting & reminder cards & notifications** option (in the **Meetings & reminders** option of your Notebook), you’ll also see your pending reminders on the Cortana **Home** page.

## Find out about upcoming meetings
This process helps you find your upcoming meetings.

1. Check to make sure your work calendar is connected and synchronized with your Azure AD account.

2. Click on the **Cortana** icon in the taskbar, and then click in the **Search** bar.

3. Type _Show me my meetings for tomorrow_.

    You’ll see all your meetings scheduled for the next day.

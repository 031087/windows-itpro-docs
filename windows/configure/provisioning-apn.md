# Configure cellular settings for tablets and PCs


**Applies to**

- WindowsÂ 10

Enterprises can configure cellular settings for tablets and PC that have built-in cellular modems or plug-in USB modem dongles and apply the settings in a [provisioning package](provisioning-packages.md). After the devices are configured, users are automatically connected using the access point name (APN) defined by the enterprise without needing to manually connect.

For users who work in different locations, you can configure one APN to connect when the users are at work and a different APN when the users are travelling.

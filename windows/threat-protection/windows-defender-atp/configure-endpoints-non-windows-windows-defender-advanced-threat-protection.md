1. In Windows Defender  Security Center portal, select the **Endpoint management** > **Non-Windows endpoint management**.

2. Make sure the 3rd-party solution is listed.

4. 	Click **Generate access token** button and then **Copy**.

5. 	Depending on the 3rd-party implementation you're using, the implementation might vary. Refer to the 3rd-party solution documentation for guidance on how to use the token.

> The access token has limited expiration period. If needed, regenerate the token close to the time you share  it with the 3rd party solution.

To effectively offboard the endpoints from the service, you'll need to disable the data push on the 3rd-party portal then switch the toggle to off in Windows Defender Security Center to block the data inbound flow.

1. Follow the 3rd party documentation to opt-out on the 3rd party service side.

2. In Windows Defender Security Center portal, select **Endpoint management**> **Non-Windows endpoint management**.

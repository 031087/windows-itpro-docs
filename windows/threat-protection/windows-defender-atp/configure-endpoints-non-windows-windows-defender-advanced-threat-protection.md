**Applies to:**

- Windows 10 Pro Education
- Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)

Windows Defender Security Center provides a centralized security operations experience for Windows as well as non-Windows platforms. You'll be able to see alerts from various supported operating systems (OS) in Windows Defender Security Center and better protect your organization's network. This experience leverages on a third-party security productsâ€™ sensor data. 

### Supported third-party solutions

-   Linux  (DAN, ARE THERE SPECIFIC VERSIONS THAT WE SUPPORT?)


## Onboard non-Windows endpoints

1. In Windows Defender Security Center portal, select **Endpoint management** > **Clients** > **Non-Windows endpoints**. Make sure the third-party solution is listed.

2. 	Toggle the Bitdefender switch button to turn on the third-party solution integration.

3. 	Click **Generate access token** button and then **Copy**.

4. 	Depending on the third-party implementation you're using, the implementation might vary. Refer to the third-party solution documentation for guidance on how to use the token.

5. Click **Save preferences**.

>[!WARNING] [DAN OR OTHER SME'S - PLEASE VERIFY IF THIS WARNING IS CORRECT. IS IT ONLY DISPLAYED ONCE?]
> The access token is only displayed once. Make sure you keep a copy of it in a safe place. If needed, regenerate the token close to the time you need to share it with the third-party solution.

## Offboard non-Windows endpoints
To effectively offboard the endpoints from the service, you'll need to disable the data push on the third-party portal then switch the toggle to off in Windows Defender Security Center to block the data inbound flow.


1. Follow the third-party documentation to opt-out on the third-party service side.

2. In Windows Defender Security Center portal, select **Endpoint management**> **Non-Windows endpoint management**.

3. Toggle the Bitdefender switch button to turn stop telemetry from endpoints with Bitdefender antivirus. 

>[!WARNING]
>If you decide to turn on the third-party integration again after disabling the integration, you'll need to regenerate the token and reapply it on endpoints.

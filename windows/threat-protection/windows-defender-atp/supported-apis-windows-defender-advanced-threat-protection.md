### Example queries
After creating the application, you can run the following queries.

Fetching the top 20 alerts with machine information:
```
private const string authority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize";
private const string resourceId = "https://graph.microsoft.com";
private const string clientId = "{YOUR CLIENT ID/APP ID HERE}";
private const string redirect = "https://localhost";
HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
AuthenticationContext auth = new AuthenticationContext(authority);
var token = auth.AcquireTokenAsync(resourceId, clientId, new Uri(redirect), new PlatformParameters(PromptBehavior.Auto)).Result;
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue(token.AccessTokenType, token.AccessToken);
var ep = $"{resourceId}/{apiVersion}/alerts?$top=20&$expand=machine"; // the query itself in yellow
HttpResponseMessage response = client.GetAsync(ep).Result;
string resp = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;
Console.WriteLine($"response for: {ep} \r\n {resp}");
``` 

Response:
```

Validate contextual information about the relevant components such as file prevalence, other machines it was observed on etc. \n3. Contact the machine's user to verify whether they received an email with a suspicious attachment or link around the time of the alert.\n4. Run a full malware scan on the machine, this may reveal additional related components. \n5. Consider submitting the relevant file(s) for deep analysis for detailed behavioral information. \n6.

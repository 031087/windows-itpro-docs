# The Windows Defender Security Center

**Applies to**

- Windows 10, version 1703




In Windows 10, version 1703 we introduced the new Windows Defender Security Center, which brings together common Windows security features into one, easy-to-use app.

> [!NOTE]
> Settings configured with management tools, such as Group Policy, Microsoft Intune, or System Center Configuration Manager, will generally take precedence over the settings in the Windows Defender Security Center. Review the settings for each feature in its appropriate library. Each of the sections described in this topic include links to configuration options for IT administrators and security operations personnel.

Access the Windows Defender Security Center:
- Right-click the icon in the notification area on the taskbar and click **Open**.

- Search the Start menu for **Windows Defender Security Center**.

Many settings that were previously part of the individual features and main Windows Settings have been combined and moved to the new app, which is installed by default as part of Windows 10, version 1703.

The app includes the settings and status for the following security features:

- Virus & threat protection, including settings for Windows Defender Antivirus
- Device performance & health, which includes information about drivers, storage space, and general Windows Update issues
- Firewall & network protection, including Windows Firewall
- App & browser control, covering Windows Defender SmartScreen settings
- Family options, which include a number of parental controls along with tips and information for keeping kids safe online


The Windows Defender Security Center operates as a separate app or process from each of these individual features, and will display notifications through the Action Center.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Disabling any one of the features individually will not disable the entire Windows Defender Security Center.

For example, [using a 3rd party antivirus will disable Windows Defender Antivirus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/deploy-manage-report-windows-defender-antivirus). However, the Windows Defender Security Center will still run, show its icon in the taskbar, and display information about the other features, such as Windows Defender SmartScreen and Windows Firewall.

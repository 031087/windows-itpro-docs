# Evaluate Windows Defender Exploit Guard


**Applies to:**

- Windows 10 Insider Preview

**Audience**

- Enterprise security administrators

Windows Defender Exploit Guard is a new collection of tools and features that help you keep your network safe from exploits. Exploits are infection vectors for malware that rely on vulnerabilities in software.

You can use Windows Defender EG to:

- Apply exploit mitigation techniques to apps your organization uses, both individually and to all apps, with [Exploit Protection](exploit-protection-exploit-guard.md)
- Reduce the attack surface that exploits can leverage, by utlizing rules that go beyond standard host-intrusion prevention systems (HIPS) with [Attack Surface Reduction rules](attack-surface-reduction-exploit.guard.md)
- Extend the malware and social engineering protection offered by Windows Defender SmartScreen in Edge to cover network traffic and connectivity outside of the browser with [Network Protection](network-protection-exploit-guard.md)
- Protect files in key system folders from changes made by malicious and suspicious apps with [Controlled Folder Access](controlled-folders-exploit-guard.md)

There are a few ways you can get started evaluating Windows Defender EG to see how it works and how it could help protect your network. This topic brings together the evaluation topics for each of the four features in Windows Defender EG.

# Attack surface reduction

## Attack surface reduction rules 

Component | Configuration available with | Event ID | Corresponds to…
-|-|-|-
Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) | GP & MDM | Provider: Windows Defender |
| | | Event when settings are changed | <Evt-ID: 5007>
| | | Event when rule fires in Audit-mode | <Evt-ID: 1122>
| | | Event when rule fires in Block-mode | <Evt-ID: 1121>


### Audit/block modes

Each of these components can individually be enabled in audit or blocking mode. 

Attack surface reduction and controlled folder access also have mitigations that can be individually enabled in audit or blocking mode. 

Component  |Description |Rule/mitigation description |
-|-|-|-
Attack surface reduction (ASR) | Provides rules that allow you to prevent macro, script and email threats. - Each rule can be enabled in audit/block mode - Supports file/folder exclusions applied to all rules |Rules to prevent macro threats |Block office application from creating executable content
| | | | Block obfuscated js/vbs/ps/macro code
| | | | Block office application from launching child processes
| | | | Block office application from injecting into other processes
| | | | Block Win32 imports from macro code in Office
| | | Rules to prevent script threats |Block js/vbs from executing payload downloaded from Internet
| | | | Block obfuscated js/vbs/ps/macro code
| | | Rules to prevent email threats |Block execution of executable content (exe, dll, ps, js, vbs, etc) dropped from email (webmail/mail-client).

 ## Evaluate

### Using the standalone configuration tool 

We’ve provided an easy-to-use configuration tool for testing purposes, called TestHIPS. The tool can be used to:

1. Enable the chosen ASR rule in either block or audit mode by creating a local GPO and running a test file that triggers the rule.

2. Enable the chosen ASR rule in either block or audit mode by creating a local GPO. 

The result of the activity can be viewed in the event log and corresponding notification (if the rule was triggered in block mode). 

You can find the tool in the evaluation package alongside this guide:
- ExploitGuardCustomerFiles/AntiMalware.Tools.TestHIPS.exe
- 
Note: You may need to change the extension in the filename from **AntiMalware.Tools.TestHIPS.rename** to **AntiMalware.Tools.TestHIPS.exe**.

For additional help with the tool, use the “-?” parameter.
 

### Using the DemoExploitGuard tool to simulate WD-EG Rules with a GUI

You can use an additional tool, called DemoExploitGuard, to test various rules by simulating scenarios that would cause the rule to issue a block or audit event, depending on the mode. DemoExploitGuard uses the TestHIPS tool to enable and configure the rules.

You can find the tool in the evaluation package alongside this guide:
- ExploitGuardCustomerFiles\AntiMalware.Tools.DemoExploitGuard.exe

Note: You may need to change the extension in the filename from **AntiMalware.Tools.DemoExploitGuard.rename** to **AntiMalware.Tools.DemoExploitGuard.exe**
**Rules**: Select one of the seven attack surface reduction rules to run.
**Mode**: Sets the behavior of the Demo Tool. 
Note: If the rule is applied by GP, this should not be an option
- **Disabled**: This scenario will execute normally and complete
- **Block**: This scenario should get blocked [ExploitGuard Block] and a notification will appear to indicate the block
- **Audit**: This scenario will not block, but will show up in the event log. Right-click the output area to go directly to the event logs for Windows Defender EG
  

### Manually enabling the attack surface reduction rules

You can also manually use GP or MDM-URIs to enable the ASR rules:

From the rules tables above, choose the ASR rules that you want to enable and set the following policy. For each rule select the right GUID.

After you’ve chosen your rules, use one of the tools above to simulate a rule to fire.
- “./Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Defender/AttackSurfaceReductionRules”
- Value as String Data Type: {75668C1F-73B5-4CF0-BB93-3ECF5CB7CC84}:2
 

### View event logs

Note: event logs are not the primary mechanism for investigation. The Windows Defender ATP portal receives much richer information that allows for investigation. Information is also presented in an interactive machine-timeline view.


#### Event fields
- **ID**: matches with the Rule-ID that triggered the block/audit.
- **Detection time**: Time of detection
- **Process Name**: The process that performed the “operation” that was blocked/audited
- **Description**: 

Windows Defender Antivirus has audited an operation that is not allowed by your IT administrator.

### View the alert notification

If you configure the test to block, a notification will be displayed from the Action Center.  This notification is customizable with your organization and contact information.
 

### Customizing Windows Defender

Customizing the Windows Defender Security Center is a simple task that provides users with a clear way to contact support.
Simply navigate in Group Policy to **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Defender Security Center\Enterprise Customization**. From there, you will be able to enable your custom notification, set your organization name and contact information.

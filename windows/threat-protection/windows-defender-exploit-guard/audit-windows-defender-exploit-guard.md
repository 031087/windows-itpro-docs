# Use audit mode to evaluate Windows Defender Exploit Guard features


You can enable each of the features of Windows Defender Explot Guard in auditing mode. This lets you see a record of what *would* have happened if you had enabled the feature.

You might want to do this when testing how the feature will work in your organization, to ensure it doesn't affect your line-of-business apps, and to get an idea of how many suspicious file modification attempts generally occur over a certain period.

This topic lists the auditing functionality available for each feature, the management tools (Group Policy, Intune, MDM CSPs, System Center Configuration Manager, or PowerShell) that can be used to configure and deploy the setting to multiple machines in your network(s), and links to configuring each feature or setting.

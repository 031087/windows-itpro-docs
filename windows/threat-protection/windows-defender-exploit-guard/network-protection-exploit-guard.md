Network Protection help prevent employees from using any application to access dangerous domains that may host phishing scams, exploits, and other malicious content on the Internet. By bringing smartscreen intel down onto the client, Network Protection block all outboud HTTP/S Traffic to low reputation sources based on Domain/Hostname

As a part of [Windows Defender Exploit Guard](windows-defender-exploit-guard.md), Network Protection reduces the attak surface of your devices from internet based threats.

Network Protection works best with [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection](../windows-defender-atp/windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection) - which gives you detailed reporting into Windows Defender EG events and blocks as part of the usual [alert investigation scenarios](../windows-defender-atp/investigate-alerts-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection).

You can enable Network Protection in either block or audit mode (non-blocking, Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection events only) with Group Policy, PowerShell, or MDM settings with CSP.


You can also use [audit mode](audit-windows-defender-exploit-guard.md) to evaluate how Network Protection would impact your organization if it were enabled.



## Requirements

The following requirements must be met before Network Protection will work:

Windows 10 version | Windows Defender Antivirus
- | -
Insider Preview build 16232 or later (dated July 1, 2017 or later) | [Windows Defender AV real-time protection](../windows-defender-antivirus/configure-real-time-protection-windows-defender-antivirus.md) and [cloud-delivered protection](../windows-defender-antivirus/enable-cloud-protection-windows-defender-antivirus.md) must be enabled


## Review Network Protection events in Windows Event Viewer


You can review the Windows event log to see events there are created when Network Protection blocked access to a malicious IP or domain:

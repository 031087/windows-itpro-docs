# Protect your network with Windows Defender Exploit Guard

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10 Insider Preview

**Audience**

- Enterprise security administrators


**Manageability available with**

- Group Policy
- PowerShell
- Configuration service providers for mobile device management


Network Protection is a feature that is part of [Windows Defender Exploit Guard](windows-defender-exploit-guard.md). It helps to prevent employees from using any application to access dangerous domains that may host phishing scams, exploits, and other malicious content on the Internet.

You can enable Network Protection in either block or auditing mode (non-blocking, Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection events only) with Group Policy, PowerShell, or MDM settings with CSP.



## Requirements

The following requirements must be met before Network Protection will work:

Windows 10 version | Windows Defender Antivirus
- | -
Insider Preview build 16232 or later (dated July 1, 2017 or later) | [Windows Defender AV real-time protection](../windows-defender-antivirus/configure-real-time-protection-windows-defender-antivirus.md) and [cloud-delivered protection](../windows-defender-antivirus/enable-cloud-protection-windows-defender-antivirus.md) must be enabled


## Review Network Protection events in Windows Event Viewer


You can review the Windows event log to see events there are created when Network Protection blocked access to a malicious IP or domain:

1. Download the [Exploit Guard Evaluation Package](#) and extract the file *np-events.xml* to an easily accessible location on the machine.

1. Type **Event viewer** in the Start menu to open the Windows Event Viewer.

2. On the left panel, under **Actions**, click **Import custom view...**

3. Navigate to the Exploit Guard Evaluation Package, and select the file *np-events.xml*. Alternatively, [download the XML directly](scripts/np-events.xml).

4. Click **OK**.

5. This will create a custom view that filters to only show the following events related to Network Protection:

 Event ID | Description
-|-
5007 | Event when settings are changed
1125 | Event when Network Protection fires in Audit-mode 
1126 | Event when Network Protection fires in Block-mode

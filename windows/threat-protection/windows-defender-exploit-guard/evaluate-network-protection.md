## Policy settings for Windows Defender EG
The MDM policy settings for Windows Defender EG are listed in this section, along with example settings. 
### Network Filter

In Windows 10, Version 1709, you can enable Windows Defender EG network protection to prevent employees from using any application to access dangerous domains that may host phishing scams, exploits, and other malicious content on the Internet.

You can enable network protection in either block or audit mode (non-blocking, ATP events only) with Group Policy, WMI/PowerShell, or MDM settings with CSP.


#### Group Policy

The network filter feature can be configured with the following Group Policy details: 
- Location:  \Microsoft\Windows Defender Exploit Guard
- Name:  Prevent users and apps from accessing dangerous websites
- Values: **Enabled**: Specify the mode in the **Options** section:
    **Block**: Users and applications will not be able to access dangerous domains
    **Audit**: Users and applications can connect to dangerous domains, however if this feature would have blocked access if it were set to block, then a record of the event will be in the event logs 

The settings in the XML file will be applied to the endpoint

**Disabled**: Users and applications will not be blocked from connecting to dangerous domains.

**Not configured**: Same as **Disabled**.

To enable network protection in block mode, select the **Enabled** value and specify **Enabled** in the drop-down sub-option menu.


#### Windows Management Instrumentation/PowerShell

Use the following cmdlet to configure network protection:
```
Set-MpPreference -EnableNetworkProtection [Disabled|Enabled|AuditMode]
```

To enable network protection in Block mode, use: 
```
Set-MpPreference -EnableNetworkProtection Enabled
```


#### Mobile device management/Configuration service provider

Use this CSP to configure network protection:
- Policy area: Defender
- Name: Defender\EnableNetworkProtection
- Supported Values:
-- 0: Disabled
-- 1: Enabled (Block Mode)
-- 2: Audit Mode

To enable network protection in block mode, set **Defender\EnableNetworkProtection** to integer 1.

### Visit a malicious domain in block mode using Internet Explorer or Google Chrome
1. Enable network protection in block mode.
1. Open Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, or any other browser of your choice.
1. Go to [https://smartscreentestratings2.net](https://smartscreentestratings2.net)

You will get a 403 Forbidden response in the browser, and you will see an Action Center message saying that Windows Defender EG blocked a connection to a malicious site.
 
### Visit a malicious domain in audit mode using Internet Explorer or Google Chrome
1. Enable network protection in audit mode.
1. Open Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, or any other browser of your choice.
1. Go to [https://smartscreentestratings2.net](https://smartscreentestratings2.net)
You will be able to navigate successfully to the site. However, you can see an audit event in Windows Defender ATP or in the Windows Event Log (under Windows Defender > Operational).


### Visit a malicious domain in Microsoft Edge
1. Enable network protection in bmode.
1. Ensure that SmartScreen is enabled. (Start -> Windows Defender Security Center -> App & browser -> SmartScreen in Microsoft Edge -> Block or Warn)
1. Open Microsoft Edge.
1. Go to [https://smartscreentestratings2.net](https://smartscreentestratings2.net)
You will see a SmartScreen malware/phishing warning. This is the 1st class experience for Microsoft Edge.


## Enabling Windows Defender EG rules in audit mode
Use the script Enable-ExploitGuardAuditMode.ps1 to turn on the ASR rules and Controlled Folder Access into audit mode via Local GP on a device. This allows one to observe how the rules would perform across various machines in your system, and determine which can be turned on in Block mode and if any exclusions need to be applied. 
**Note:** Rename Enable-ExploitGuardAuditMode.rename to Enable-ExploitGuardAuditMode.ps1
Run the following in an elevated powershell prompt:
- Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force
- .\Enable-ExploitGuardAuditMode.ps1
Successful output should indicate ASR and Controlled Folder Access were turned on in audit mode 


## Monitoring with Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection
Windows Defender EG events can be found in event logs, or if the enterprise uses Windows Defender ATP, the Windows Defender Security Center

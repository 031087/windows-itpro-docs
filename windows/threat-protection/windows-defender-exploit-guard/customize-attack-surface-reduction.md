Attack Surface Reduction is a feature that is part of Windows Defender Exploit Guard. It helps prevent actions and apps that are typically used by exploit-seeking malware to infect machines. 

This topic describes how to customize Attack Surface Reduction by [excluding files and folders](#exclude-files-and-folders) or [adding custom text to the notification](#customize-the-notification) alert that appears on a user's computer.

## Exclude files and folders

You can exclude files and folders from being evaluated by Attack Surface Reduction rules. You can specify individual files or folders (using folder paths or fully qualified resource names) but you cannot specify if the files should be excluded from individual rules: the exclusions will apply to all rules that are enabled (or placed in audit mode).


1.  On your Group Policy management machine, open the [Group Policy Management Console](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc731212.aspx), right-click the Group Policy Object you want to configure and click **Edit**.

3.  In the **Group Policy Management Editor** go to **Computer configuration**.

4.  Click **Policies** then **Administrative templates**.

5.  Expand the tree to **Windows components > Windows Defender Antivirus > Windows Defender Exploit Guard > Attack Surface Reduction**.

6. Double-click the **Exclude files and paths from Attack Surface Reduction Rules** setting and set the option to **Enabled**. Click **Show** and enter each file or folder in the **Value name** column. Enter **0** in the **Value** column for each item. 


## Customize the notification

Customizing the Windows Defender Security Center is a simple task that provides users with a clear way to contact support.
Simply navigate in Group Policy to **Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Defender Security Center\Enterprise Customization**. From there, you will be able to enable your custom notification, set your organization name and contact information.

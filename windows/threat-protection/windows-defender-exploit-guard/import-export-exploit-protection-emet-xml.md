**Use Group Policy to import and deploy system-level mitigations:**

3.  In the **Group Policy Management Editor** go to **Computer configuration**.

4.  Click **Policies** then **Administrative templates**.

5.  Expand the tree to **Windows components > Windows Defender Antivirus > Exploit Guard**.

6. Double-click the **Configure controlled folder access** setting and set the option to **Enabled**. In the options section you must specify one of the following:
    - **Enable** - Malicious and suspicious apps will not be allowed to make changes to files in protected folders. A notification will be provided in the Windows event log
    - **Disable (Default)** - The Controlled Folder Access feature will not work. All apps can make changes to files in protected folders.
    - **Audit Mode** - If a malicious or suspicious app attempts to make a change to a file in a protected folder, the change will be allowed but will be recorded in the Windows event log. This allows you to assess the impact of this feature on your organization.

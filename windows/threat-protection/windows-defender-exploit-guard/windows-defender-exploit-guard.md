# Windows Defender Exploit Guard


**Applies to:**

- Windows 10 Insider Preview

**Audience**

- Enterprise security administrators

Windows Defender Exploit Guard is a new collection of tools and features that help you keep your network safe from exploits. Exploits are infection vectors for malware that rely on vulnerabilities in software.

You can use Windows Defender EG to:

- Apply exploit mitigation techniques to apps your organization uses, both individually and to all apps, with [Exploit Protection](exploit-protection-exploit-guard.md)
- Reduce the attack surface that exploits can leverage, by utlizing rules that go beyond standard host-intrusion prevention systems (HIPS) with [Attack Surface Reduction rules](attack-surface-reduction-exploit-guard.md)
- Extend the malware and social engineering protection offered by Windows Defender SmartScreen in Edge to cover network traffic and connectivity outside of the browser with [Network Protection](network-protection-exploit-guard.md)
- Protect files in key system folders from changes made by malicious and suspicious apps with [Controlled Folder Access](controlled-folders-exploit-guard.md)

Evaluate Windows Defender EG with our evaluation and set-up guide, which provides a pre-built PowerShell script and testing tool so you can see the new features in action:
- [Evaluate Windows Defender Exploit Guard](evaluate-windows-defender-exploit-guard.md)

You can also [enable audit mode](audit-windows-defender-exploit-guard.md) for Windows Defender EG, which provides with reporting and event logs that indicate how the feature would have responded if it had been fully enabled. This can be useful when evaluating the impact of Windows Defender EG and to help determine the impact of the features on your network's security.

Windows Defender EG can be managed and reported on in the Windows Defender Security Center as part of the Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection suite of threat mitigation, preventing, protection, and analysis technologies, which also includes:
- [The Windows Defender ATP console](../windows-defender-atp/windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md)
- [Windows Defender Antivirus in Windows 10](../windows-defender-antivirus/windows-defender-antivirus-in-windows-10.md)
- [Windows Defender SmartScreen](../windows-defender-smartscreen/windows-defender-smartscreen-overview.md)
- [Windows Defender Device Guard]
- [Windows Defender Application Guard](../windows-defender-application-guard/wd-app-guard-overview.md)

Each of the features in Windows Defender EG have slightly different requirements:

Feature | Windows Defender Antivirus | Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection license 
-|-|-|-
Exploit Protection | No requirement | Required for reporting in the Windows Defender ATP console
Attack Surface Reduction | Must be enabled | Required
Network Protection | Must be enabled | Required for reporting in the Windows Defender ATP console
Controlled Folder Access | Must be enabled | Required for reporting in the Windows Defender ATP console

> [!NOTE]
> Each feature's requirements are further described in the individual topics in this library.

The way in which the features can be managed, configured, and reported on also varies:

 Feature | Configuration available with | Reporting available with
-|-|-
Exploit Protection | System Center Configuration Manager, Group Policy, Microsoft Intune, Mobile device management policies, PowerShell, Windows Defender Security Center  | Windows Event logs
Attack Surface Reduction | Group Policy, Microsoft Intune, Mobile device management policies, Windows Defender Security Center  | 
Network Protection | System Center Configuration Manager, Group Policy, Microsoft Intune, Mobile device management policies, Windows Defender Security Center  |

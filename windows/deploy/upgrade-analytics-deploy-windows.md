Select **Export computers** for more details, including computer name, manufacturer and model, and Windows edition currently running on the computer. Sort or further query the data and then select **Export** to generate and save a comma-separated value (csv) list of upgrade-ready computers.

IMPORTANT: When viewing inventory items in table view, the maximum number of rows that can be viewed and exported is limited to 5,000. If you need to view or export more than 5,000 items, reduce the scope of the query so you can export fewer items at a time.

# Resolve common Windows 10 upgrade errors

**Applies to**
-   WindowsÂ 10

This topic provides a brief introduction to Windows 10 installation processes and provides resolution procedures you can use to resolve common problems.

## The Windows 10 upgrade process

The Windows Setup application is used to upgrade a computer to Windows 10, or to perform a clean installation. Windows Setup starts and restarts the computer, gathers information, copies files, and creates or adjusts configuration settings. When performing an operating system upgrade, Windows Setup uses the following phases:

1. **Downlevel phase**: The downlevel phase is run within the previous operating system. Installation components are gathered.
2. **Safe OS phase**: A recovery partition is configured and updates are installed. An OS rollback is prepared if needed.
        - Example error codes: 0x2000C, 0x20017
3. **First boot phase**: Initial settings are applied.
        - Example error codes: 0x30018, 0x3000D
4. **Second boot phase**: Final settings are applied. This is also called the **OOBE boot phase**.
        - Example error: 0x4000D, 0x40017
5. **Uninstall phase**: This phase occurs if upgrade is unsuccessful.
        - Example error: 0x50011, 0x50012

**Figure 1**: Phases of a successful Windows 10 upgrade (uninstall is not shown):

DU = Driver/device updates.<BR>
OOBE = Out of box experience.<BR>
WIM = Windows image (Microsoft)

## Upgrade error codes

Setup will return two codes:

1. A result code, corresponding to a specific Win32 error.
2. An extend code, representing the phase when a failure occurred.
        - The extend code contains information about both the *phase* in which an error occurred, and the *operation* that was being performed when the error occurred.  

>For example, a result code of **0xC1900101** with an extend code of **0x4000D** will be returned as: **0xC1900101 - 0x4000D**. In this case, the extend code **0x4000D** can be evaluated as representing a problem during phase 4 (**0x4**) with data migration (**000D**). A list of extend codes with phase and operation associations is provided below.

Note: If only a result code is returned, this can be because a tool is being used that was not able to capture the extend code. For example, if you are using the [Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3159635) then only a result code might be returned.

### Extend codes

The following tables provide the corresponding phase and operation for values of an extend code:

## Log files

Various log files are created during each phase of the upgrade process. These log files are essential for troubleshooting upgrade problems. The most useful log is **setupact.log**. These logs are located in a different folder depending on the Windows Setup phase. Recall that you can determine the phase from the extend code. 

<P>The following table describes some log files and how to use them for troubleshooting purposes:

</TABLE>



## Common error codes

A common result code is 0xC1900101. This result code can be thrown at any stage of the upgrade process, with the exception of the SafeOS phase. 0xC1900101 usually indicates that an incompatible driver is present, which can cause blue screens, system hangs, and unexpected reboots. Analysis of supplemental log files is often helpful in indentifying the incompatible driver. You can also attempt to run setup in the absence of drivers by performing a [clean boot](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135) before initiating the upgrade process. 

<P>The following general procedures can be used to diagnose some of the most common error codes that contain a result code of 0xC1900101:

File: \Windows\system32\boot\winload.exe
Status:0xc0000428
Info: Windows cannot verify the digital signature for this file."<TD>"In order to fix this error, we need to look for the file that is causing the issue. The file listed in the cause section may vary as well. When this error occurs, the machine / device will show a bluescreen and will not be in a useable state. At this point, we would need to perform Automatic Repair using Windows 10 installation media. The Drivers, conflicts with other programs, malware, and memory can all cause startup problems. 
Automatic repair can detect and fix problems that prevent your PC from starting. Refer to the steps:

a. Insert the installation USB media and boot Windows Technical Preview from it.
b. In the âWindows setupâ page select the âlanguage to installâ, âTime and currency formatâ and the âkeyboard or input methodâ and click on ânextâ.
c. Click on âRepair your computerâ and select âTroubleshootâ.
d. Select âAutomatic Repairâ and select the operating system.
e. You will then see a blue screen and an option to choose. Choose the option Troubleshoot and select advanced options.
 f. You may choose Automatic Repair from Advanced boot option.
 g. Follow the instructions.

The above steps should fix the issue and get the driver signatures back as well for the corrupted drivers. If that does not help, then we may not have any other option than performing a Clean Install of Windows 10 on the machine / device. You can create a Windows 10 installation Disc and perform a clean installation on the computer. To create a please find the below link:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 

Once the media is created by the tool, it will walk you through how to set up Windows 10 on your PC. During setup, you might be asked to enter a product key.
 If you bought Windows 10 and are installing it for the first time, youâll need to enter the Windows 10 product key you received in the confirmation email after your purchase. If you donât have a product key and youâve not previously upgraded to Windows 10, select I need to buy a Windows 10 product key.

Before initiating the setup, we should make sure:
1. The device (Laptop or Surface) it should be connected to power source and adequately charged.
2. The user is not cancelling the setup on the Black Screen, when the setup.exe is installing devices and configuring user settings.
PS: It takes time on the device configuration and migration depending upon the Speed of the CPU and the amount of RAM on the system. 
"</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>0xC1900208 -1047526904<TD>This error occurs when the computer does not pass the compatibility check for upgrading to Windows 10.<TD>"This error comes when there is software/driver which is not yet certified to be compatible with windows 10.

There are couple of solutions for this issue:
Solution 1: Disk Space
Check and Make sure that we have good amount of free disk space on the OS partition. Disk space requirements:
a. For 32-bit: Greater than 16gb
b. For 64-Bit: Greater than 20gb

Solution 2: Upgrade Path
We need to make sure that we are upgrading the existing OS, to the New Version as per the guidelines described in https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/windows/deploy/windows-10-upgrade-paths?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396

Solution: Media Creation Tool
Use the Media Creation tool and create an ISO and then start the upgrade of the OS. The tool can be downloaded from: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209

# Resolve common Windows 10 upgrade errors

**Applies to**
-   WindowsÂ 10

This topic provides a brief introduction to Windows 10 installation processes and provides resolution procedures you can use to resolve common problems.

## The Windows 10 upgrade process

The Windows Setup application is used to upgrade a computer to Windows 10, or to perform a clean installation. Windows Setup starts and restarts the computer, gathers information, copies files, and creates or adjusts configuration settings. When performing an operating system upgrade, Windows Setup uses the following phases:

1. **Downlevel phase**: The downlevel phase is run within the previous operating system. Installation components are gathered.
2. **Safe OS phase**: A recovery partition is configured and updates are installed. An OS rollback is prepared if needed.
        - Example error codes: 0x2000C, 0x20017
3. **First boot phase**: Initial settings are applied.
        - Example error codes: 0x30018, 0x3000D
4. **Second boot phase**: Final settings are applied. This is also called the **OOBE boot phase**.
        - Example error: 0x4000D, 0x40017
5. **Rollback phase**: This phase occurs if upgrade is unsuccessful.
        - Example error: 0x50011, 0x50012

**Figure 1**: Phases of a successful Windows 10 upgrade (rollback is not shown):

DU = Driver/device updates.<BR>
OOBE = Out of box experience.<BR>
WIM = Windows image (Microsoft)

## Upgrade error codes

Setup will return two codes:

1. A result code, corresponding to a specific Win32 error.
2. An extend code, corresponding to the phase and the operation when a failure occurred.

For example, a result code of **0xC1900101** with an extend code of **0x4000D** will be returned as: **0xC1900101 - 0x4000D**

Note: If only a single code is returned, this can be because a tool is being used that does not capture the extend code, for example the [Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3159635).

### Extend codes

The phase and operation of an extend code maps to the following tables.

For example: You can use these tables to interpret extend code of 0x**4**</font>00**0D**</font> as a problem during phase 4 with data migration (**4** = SP_EXECUTION_OOBE_BOOT, **0D** = SP_EXECUTION_OP_MIGRATE_DATE).

## Log files

During each phase of the upgrade process, setup log files are created in various locations. These log files can be very useful in troubleshooting upgrade problems.

1. Make sure you have enough disk space.<BR>
2. If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver, or check with the manufacturer for driver updates.<BR>
3. Try changing video adapters.<BR>
4. Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates.<BR>
5. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.

Using External Drive
If your device allows it, you can use an external USB drive for the upgrade process. Windows setup will backup the previous version of Windows to a USB external drive. The external drive must be at least 8GB â but having 16GB is recommended. 
Some important points to remember if you choose to use an external storage drive for installing Windows 10:
 - We recommend that the external drive is formatted in NTFS.  Drives that are formatted in FAT32 may run into errors due to FAT32 file size limitations.  To learn   how to format in NTFS, click here.
- USB drives are preferred over SD cards because drivers for SD cards are not migrated if the device does not support Connected Standby.

<TR><TD>Contact your system administrator to upgrade Windows Server or Enterprise Editions<TD>This issue occurs if you run the updater tool. The tool works only with the Windows 10 Home, Pro, and Education editions.<TD>To resolve this issue, use a different method to upgrade to Windows 10 version 1607. For example, download the ISO, and then run Setup from it.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>When doing an upgrade to Windows Version 1607 is it supported to use a custom install.wim (sysprepped) instead of the default install.wim that comes with Windows Version 1607 <TD>Unsupported<TD>It is not supported to replace the install.wim with custom wim (sysprepped or not). It is supported to do some minor changes to the default install.wim such as injecting latest cumulative update or remove inbox apps. </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>0xC1420127<TD>The typical conversion of the error means that the specified image in the specified wim is already mounted for read/write access. When we launch the setup.exe, it checks the registry key. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WIMMount\Mounted Images to check for any previously mounted WIM files on the system and if the image is mounted we will get this error.<TD>This error would be very rare on Upgrades of WIN10 specially when upgrading to the Anniversary 1607 Build. This issue has been fixed with the Cumulative updates released in June 2016 for Windows 10. When we perform an Upgrade, it is recommended to Perform a Windows Update first and apply all important updates on the current OS and then start the Upgrade process for Windows 10.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>0x8004100E<TD>This error code indicates that there is a problem with an Application that has an Invalid WMI Namespace<TD>In order to fix this problem, we need to open Application Event log and Check for Errors for various applications that could be causing this error.

<TR><TD>0XC0000428<TD>"This error occurs when the digital signatures for one of the Boot Critical Drivers has not been verified. In most cases, we will see an error on Bootup which will be similar to as below:
File: \Windows\system32\boot\winload.exe
Status:0xc0000428
Info: Windows cannot verify the digital signature for this file."<TD>"In order to fix this error, we need to look for the file that is causing the issue. The file listed in the cause section may vary as well. When this error occurs, the machine / device will show a bluescreen and will not be in a useable state. At this point, we would need to perform Automatic Repair using Windows 10 installation media. The Drivers, conflicts with other programs, malware, and memory can all cause startup problems. 
Automatic repair can detect and fix problems that prevent your PC from starting. Refer to the steps:

a. Insert the installation USB media and boot Windows Technical Preview from it.
b. In the âWindows setupâ page select the âlanguage to installâ, âTime and currency formatâ and the âkeyboard or input methodâ and click on ânextâ.
c. Click on âRepair your computerâ and select âTroubleshootâ.
d. Select âAutomatic Repairâ and select the operating system.
e. You will then see a blue screen and an option to choose. Choose the option Troubleshoot and select advanced options.
 f. You may choose Automatic Repair from Advanced boot option.
 g. Follow the instructions.

The above steps should fix the issue and get the driver signatures back as well for the corrupted drivers. If that does not help, then we may not have any other option than performing a Clean Install of Windows 10 on the machine / device. You can create a Windows 10 installation Disc and perform a clean installation on the computer. To create a please find the below link:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 

Once the media is created by the tool, it will walk you through how to set up Windows 10 on your PC. During setup, you might be asked to enter a product key.
 If you bought Windows 10 and are installing it for the first time, youâll need to enter the Windows 10 product key you received in the confirmation email after your purchase. If you donât have a product key and youâve not previously upgraded to Windows 10, select I need to buy a Windows 10 product key.

<TR><TD>0xc1900106<TD>This indicate that upgrade process was forcefully terminated either by Rebooting or forcefully canceling the setup. <TD>"We recommended that when the Windows 10 Upgrade is initiated, one should not terminate the process at any time until the Setup completes. Before initiating the setup, we should make sure:
1. The device (Laptop or Surface) it should be connected to power source and adequately charged.
2. The user is not cancelling the setup on the Black Screen, when the setup.exe is installing devices and configuring user settings.
PS: It takes time on the device configuration and migration depending upon the Speed of the CPU and the amount of RAM on the system. 
"</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>0xC1900208 -1047526904<TD>This error occurs when the computer does not pass the compatibility check for upgrading to Windows 10.<TD>"This error comes when there is software/driver which is not yet certified to be compatible with windows 10. Hence you might want to re-run the compatibility check before initiating the Upgrade. 
Refer AskCore Blog: Using the Windows 10 Compatibility Reports to understand upgrade issues (https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askcore/2016/01/21/using-the-windows-10-compatibility-reports-to-understand-upgrade-issues/)

Once you have found the in-compatible software/drivers:
1. Uninstall incompatible software or hardware or driver, 
2. Now re-run the compatibility check just to verify that there no more in-compatible software/driver on the machine. 
3. If it comes clean, initiate the upgrade.
4. Else, repeat the steps until the compatibility check is clean.

"</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Unable to resurrect NewSystem object. hr=0x80070002<TD>"This error occurs when the setup.exe is unable to create the newsystem data file when the upgrade starts. If we look at the C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther\diagerr.xml, we should see something like:
CSetupPlatform::ResurrectNewSystem: 
Failure: Win32Exception: \\?\C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\NewSystem.dat: 
The system cannot find the file specified. [0x00000002] __cdecl    
UnBCL::FileStream::FileStream(const class UnBCL::String *,enum 
UnBCL::FileMode,enum UnBCL::FileAccess,enum UnBCL::FileShare,unsigned long)"<TD>"The NewSystem.dat is an operational file that is created at the beginning of the upgrade process and used at various points in the setup phase like driver migrations; disk space detections; Platforms detections and creating a base image of the new OS that is extracted from the INSTALL.WIM, which is the source file for the upgrade.
There are couple of solutions for this issue:
Solution 1: Disk Space
Check and Make sure that we have good amount of free disk space on the OS partition. Disk space requirements:
a. For 32-bit: Greater than 16gb
b. For 64-Bit: Greater than 20gb

Solution 2: Upgrade Path
We need to make sure that we are upgrading the existing OS, to the New Version as per the guidelines described in https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/windows/deploy/windows-10-upgrade-paths?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396

Solution: Media Creation Tool
Use the Media Creation tool and create an ISO and then start the upgrade of the OS. The tool can be downloaded from: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209

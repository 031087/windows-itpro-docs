# Use Upgrade Analytics to manage Windows upgrades

This topic explains how to use the Upgrade Analytics solution to plan, manage, and deploy Windows upgrades.

Based on telemetry data from user computers, Upgrade Analytics identifies application and driver compatibility issues that may block Windows upgrades, allowing you to make data-driven decisions about your organization’s upgrade readiness.

You and your IT team can use the Upgrade Analytics workflow to prioritize and work through application and driver issues, assign and track issue resolution status, and identify computers that are ready to upgrade. You can then export the list of upgrade-ready computers and start deploying Windows with confidence, knowing that you’ve addressed potential blocking issues.

Information is refreshed daily so you can monitor upgrade progress. Any changes your team makes, such as assigning application importance and marking applications as ready to upgrade, are reflected 24 hours after you make them.

The Upgrade Analytics workflow gives you compatibility and usage information about computers, applications, and drivers and walks you through these high-level tasks. Each task is described in more detail in the topics that follow.

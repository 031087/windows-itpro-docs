# Upgrade Analytics - Step 2: Resolve app and driver issues

This section of the Upgrade Analytics workflow reports application and driver inventory and shows you which applications have known issues, which applications have no known issues, and which drivers have issues. We identify applications and drivers that need attention and suggest fixes when we know about them.

You can change an application’s upgrade decision and a driver’s upgrade decision from the blades in this section. To change an application’s or a driver’s importance level, select **User changes**. Select the item you want to change and then select the appropriate option from the **Select upgrade decision** list.

Upgrade decisions include:

| Upgrade decision   | When to use it    | Guidance    |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Not reviewed       | All drivers are marked as Not reviewed by default.<br><br>Any app that has not been marked **Low install count** will also have an upgrade decision of **Not reviewed** by default. <br>                                                                                                                                                                                      | Apps you have not yet reviewed or are waiting to review later should be marked as **Not reviewed**. When you start to investigate an application or a driver to determine upgrade readiness, change their upgrade decision to **Review in progress**.<br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Review in progress | When you start to investigate an application or a driver to determine upgrade readiness, change its upgrade decision to **Review in progress**.<br><br>Until you’ve determined that applications and drivers will migrate successfully or you’ve resolved blocking issues, leave the upgrade decision status as **Review in progress**. <br><br> | Once you’ve fixed any issues and validated that the application or driver will migrate successfully, change the upgrade decision to **Ready to upgrade**. <br>                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Ready to upgrade   | Mark applications and drivers **Ready to upgrade** once you’ve resolved all blocking issues and you’re confident that they will upgrade successfully, or if you’ve decided to upgrade them as-is.                                                                                                                                                          | Applications with no known issues and with low installation rates are marked **Ready to upgrade** by default.<br><br>In Step 1, you might have marked some of your apps as **Ignore**.  These should be marked as **Ready to upgrade**. Apps with low installation rates are marked as **Ready to upgrade** by default.  Be sure to review any low install count applications for any business critical or important applications that are not yet upgrade-ready, despite their low installation rates. <br> |
| Won’t upgrade      | By default, no applications or drivers are marked **Won’t upgrade** because only you can make that determination. <br><br>Use **Won’t upgrade** for applications and drivers that you do not work on your target operating system, or that you are unable to upgrade.<br>                                                                                                                                                        | If, during your investigation into an application or driver, you determine that they should not or cannot be upgraded, mark them **Won’t upgrade**. <br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The blades in the **Resolve issues** section are:

- Review applications with known issues
- Review applications with no known issues
- Review drivers with known issues

As you review applications with known issues, you can also see ISV support statements or applications using [Ready for Windows](https://www.readyforwindows.com/).

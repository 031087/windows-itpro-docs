# Manage Windows upgrades with Upgrade Analytics

Upgrading to new operating systems has traditionally been a challenging, complex, and slow process for many enterprises. Discovering applications and drivers and then testing them for potential compatibility issues have been among the biggest pain points.

With the release of Upgrade Analytics, enterprises now have the tools to plan and manage the upgrade process end to end, allowing them to adopt new Windows releases more quickly. With new Windows versions being released multiple times a year, ensuring application and driver compatibility on an ongoing basis is key to adopting new Windows versions as they are released.  

Microsoft developed Upgrade Analytics in response to demand from enterprise customers looking for additional direction and details about upgrading to Windows 10. Upgrade Analytics was built taking into account multiple channels of customer feedback, testing, and Microsoft’s experience upgrading millions of devices to Windows 10. 

With Windows telemetry enabled, Upgrade Analytics collects system, application, and driver data for analysis. We then identify compatibility issues that can block an upgrade and suggest fixes when they are known to Microsoft.

Use Upgrade Analytics to get:

-   A visual workflow that guides you from pilot to production

-   Detailed computer and application inventory

-   Powerful computer level search and drill-downs

-   Guidance and insights into application and driver compatibility issues, with suggested fixes

-   Data driven application rationalization tools

-   Application usage information, allowing targeted validation; workflow to track validation progress and decisions

-   Data export to commonly used software deployment tools, including System Center Configuration Manager

The Upgrade Analytics workflow steps you through the discovery and rationalization process until you have a list of computers that are ready to be upgraded.

>**Important**<br> For system, application, and driver data to be shared with Microsoft, you must configure user computers to send data. For information about what telemetry data Microsoft collects and how that data is used and protected by Microsoft, see:

# Deploy Windows 10 in a test lab using System Center Configuration Manager

**Applies to**

-   Windows 10

**Important**: This guide leverages the proof of concept (PoC) environment configured using procedures in [Step by step guide: Deploy Windows 10 in a test lab](windows-10-poc.md) and requires that you have completed completed procedures in [Deploy Windows 10 in a test lab using Microsoft Deployment Toolkit](windows-10-poc-mdt.md). Please complete all steps in these guides before attempting the procedures in this guide. If you wish to skip the Windows 10 deployment procedures in the MDT guide and move directly to this guide, you must at least install MDT and the Windows ADK before performing procedures in this guide.

The PoC environment is a virtual network running on Hyper-V with three virtual machines (VMs):
- **DC1**: A contoso.com domain controller, DNS server, and DHCP server.
- **SRV1**: A dual-homed contoso.com domain member server, DNS server, and default gateway providing NAT service for the PoC network.
- **PC1**: A contoso.com member computer running Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1 that has been cloned from a physical computer on your corporate network for testing purposes.

This guide leverages the Hyper-V server role to perform procedures. If you do not complete all steps in a single session, consider using [checkpoints](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn818483.aspx) and [saved states](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ee247418.aspx) to pause, resume, or restart your work.

>Multiple features and services are installed on SRV1 in this guide. If less than 4 GB of RAM is allocated to SRV1, some procedures will require more time to complete. If resources are limited on the Hyper-V host, consider reducing RAM allocation on DC1 and PC1 to 2 GB and 1 GB respectively, and then increasing the RAM allocation on SRV1. You can adjust RAM allocation for a VM by right-clicking the VM in the Hyper-V Manager console, clicking **Settings**, clicking **Memory**, and modifying the value next to **Maximum RAM**.

## In this guide

Description here.

## Install prerequisites

1. Before installing System Center Configuration Manager, we must install prerequisite services and features. Type the following command at an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt on SRV1: 

    ```
    Install-WindowsFeature Web-Windows-Auth,Web-ISAPI-Ext,Web-Metabase,Web-WMI,BITS,RDC,NET-Framework-Features,Web-Asp-Net,Web-Asp-Net45,NET-HTTP-Activation,NET-Non-HTTP-Activ
    ```

    >If the request to add features fails, retry the installation by typing the command again.

2. Download [SQL Server 2012 SP2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2014-sp2) from the Microsoft Evaluation Center as an .ISO file on the Hyper-V host computer. Save the file to the **C:\VHD** directory.
3. When you have downloaded the file **SQLServer2014SP2-FullSlipstream-x64-ENU.iso** and placed it in the C:\VHD directory, type the following command at an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt on the Hyper-V host: 

    ```
    Set-VMDvdDrive -VMName SRV1 -Path c:\VHD\SQLServer2014SP2-FullSlipstream-x64-ENU.iso
    ```

    This command mounts the .ISO file to drive D on SRV1.

4. Type the following command at an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt on SRV1 to install SQL Server 2012 SP2:

    ```
    D:\setup.exe /q /ACTION=Install /ERRORREPORTING="False" /FEATURES=SQLENGINE,RS,IS,SSMS,TOOLS,ADV_SSMS,CONN /INSTANCENAME=MSSQLSERVER /INSTANCEDIR="C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server" /SQLSVCACCOUNT="NT AUTHORITY\System" /SQLSYSADMINACCOUNTS="BUILTIN\ADMINISTRATORS" /SQLSVCSTARTUPTYPE=Automatic /AGTSVCACCOUNT="NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" /AGTSVCSTARTUPTYPE=Automatic /RSSVCACCOUNT="NT AUTHORITY\System" /RSSVCSTARTUPTYPE=Automatic /ISSVCACCOUNT="NT AUTHORITY\System" /ISSVCSTARTUPTYPE=Disabled /ASCOLLATION="Latin1_General_CI_AS" /SQLCOLLATION="SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS" /TCPENABLED="1" /NPENABLED="1" /IAcceptSQLServerLicenseTerms
    ```
    Installation will take several minutes. When installation is complete, the following output will be displayed:

    ```

    C:\RemoteInstall\SMSImages\PS100006\WinPE.PS100006.wim
    ```

    >The first two images (*.wim files) are default boot images. The third is the new boot image with DaRT.

## Create a Windows 10 reference image

If you have already completed steps in [Deploy Windows 10 in a test lab using Microsoft Deployment Toolkit](windows-10-poc-mdt.md) then you have already created a Windows 10 reference image. In this case, skip to the next procedure in this guide: [Add a Windows 10 operating system image](#add-a-windows-10-operating-system-image). If you have not yet created a Windows 10 reference image, complete the steps in this section.

1. In [Step by step guide: Deploy Windows 10 in a test lab](windows-10-poc.md) the Windows 10 Enterprise .iso file was saved to the c:\VHD directory as **c:\VHD\w10-enterprise.iso**. The first step in creating a deployment share is to mount this file on SRV1.  To mount the Windows 10 Enterprise DVD on SRV1, open an elevated Windows PowerShell prompt on the Hyper-V host computer and type the following command:

    ```
    Set-VMDvdDrive -VMName SRV1 -Path c:\VHD\w10-enterprise.iso
    ```
2. Verify that the Windows Enterprise installation DVD is mounted on SRV1 as drive letter D.

3. The Windows 10 Enterprise installation files will be used to create a deployment share on SRV1 using the MDT deployment workbench. To open the deployment workbench, click **Start**, type **deployment**, and then click **Deployment Workbench**.

4. In the Deployment Workbench console, right-click **Deployment Shares** and select **New Deployment Share**.

5. Use the following settings for the New Deployment Share Wizard:
    - Deployment share path: **C:\MDTBuildLab**<BR>
    - Share name: **MDTBuildLab$**<BR>
    - Deployment share description: **MDT build lab**<BR>
    - Options: click **Next** to accept the default<BR>
    - Summary: click **Next**<BR>
    - Progress: settings will be applied<BR>
    - Confirmation: click **Finish**

6. Expand the **Deployment Shares** node, and then expand **MDT build lab**.

7. Right-click the **Operating Systems** node, and then click **New Folder**. Name the new folder **Windows 10**. Complete the wizard using default values and click **Finish**.

7. Right-click the **Windows 10** folder created in the previous step, and then click **Import Operating System**.

8. Use the following settings for the Import Operating System Wizard: 
    - OS Type: **Full set of source files**<BR>
    - Source: **D:\\** <BR>
    - Destination: **W10Ent_x64**<BR>
    - Summary: click **Next**
    - Confirmation: click **Finish**

9. For purposes of this test lab, we will not add applications, such as Microsoft Office, to the deployment share. For information about adding applications, see the [Add applications](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/windows/deploy/create-a-windows-10-reference-image#sec03) section of the [Create a Windows 10 reference image](create-a-windows-10-reference-image.md) topic in the TechNet library.

10. The next step is to create a task sequence to reference the operating system that was imported. To create a task sequence, right-click the **Task Sequences** node under **MDT Build Lab** and then click **New Task Sequence**. Use the following settings for the New Task Sequence Wizard:
    - Task sequence ID: **REFW10X64-001**<BR>
    - Task sequence name: **Windows 10 Enterprise x64 Default Image** <BR>
    - Task sequence comments: **Reference Build**<BR>
    - Template: **Standard Client Task Sequence**
    - Select OS: click **Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation in W10Ent_x64 install.wim**
    - Specify Product Key: **Do not specify a product key at this time**
    - Full Name: **Contoso**
    - Organization: **Contoso**
    - Internet Explorer home page: **http://www.contoso.com**
    - Admin Password: **Do not specify an Administrator password at this time**
    - Summary: click **Next**
    - Confirmation: click **Finish**

11. Edit the task sequence to add the Microsoft NET Framework 3.5, which is required by many applications. To edit the task sequence, double-click **Windows 10 Enterprise x64 Default Image** that was created in the previous step.

12. Click the **Task Sequence** tab. Under **State Restore** click **Tatto** to highlight it, then click **Add** and choose **New Group**. A new group will be added under Tattoo.

13. On the Properties tab of the group that was created in the previous step, change the Name from New Group to **Custom Tasks (Pre-Windows Update)** and then click **Apply**. To see the name change, click **Tattoo**, then click the new group again.

14. Click the **Custom Tasks (Pre-Windows Update)** group again, click **Add**, point to **Roles**, and then click **Install Roles and Features**. 

15. Under **Select the roles and features that should be installed**, select **.NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0)** and then click **Apply**.

16. Enable Windows Update in the task sequence by clicking the **Windows Update (Post-Application Installation)** step, clicking the **Options** tab, and clearing the **Disable this step** checkbox.
    >Note: Since we are not installing applications in this test lab, there is no need to enable the Windows Update Pre-Application Installation step. However, you should enable this step if you are also installing applications.

17. Click **OK** to complete editing the task sequence.

18. The next step is to configure the MDT deployment share rules. To configure rules in the Deployment Workbench, right-click MDT build lab (C:\MDTBuildLab) and click **Properties**, and then click the **Rules** tab.

19. Replace the default rules with the following text:

    ```
    [Settings]

    ```

21. Click **OK** to complete the configuration of the deployment share.

22. Right-click **MDT build lab (C:\MDTBuildLab)** and then click **Update Deployment Share**.

23. Accept all default values in the Update Deployment Share Wizard by clicking **Next**.  The update process will take 5 to 10 minutes. When it has completed, click **Finish**.

24. Copy **c:\MDTBuildLab\Boot\LiteTouchPE_x86.iso** on SRV1 to the **c:\VHD** directory on the Hyper-V host computer. Note that in MDT, the x86 boot image can deploy both x86 and x64 operating systems, except on computers based on Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI).

    >Hint: Top copy the file, right-click the **LiteTouchPE_x86.iso** file and click **Copy** on SRV1, then open the **c:\VHD** folder on the Hyper-V host, right-click inside the folder and click **Paste**. 

25. Open a Windows PowerShell prompt on the Hyper-V host computer and type the following commands:

    ```
    New-VM –Name REFW10X64-001 -SwitchName poc-internal -NewVHDPath "c:\VHD\REFW10X64-001.vhdx" -NewVHDSizeBytes 60GB 
    Set-VMMemory -VMName REFW10X64-001 -DynamicMemoryEnabled $true -MinimumBytes 1024MB -MaximumBytes 1024MB -Buffer 20
    Set-VMDvdDrive -VMName REFW10X64-001 -Path c:\VHD\LiteTouchPE_x86.iso
    Start-VM REFW10X64-001
    vmconnect localhost REFW10X64-001
    ```
26. In the Windows Deployment Wizard, select **Windows 10 Enterprise x64 Default Image**, and then click **Next**.

27. Accept the default values on the Capture Image page, and click **Next**. Operating system installation will complete after 5 to 10 minutes and then the VM will reboot automatically. Allow the system to boot normally (do not press a key). The process is fully automated.

    Additional system restarts will occur to complete updating and preparing the operating system. Setup will complete the following procedures:

    - Install the Windows 10 Enterprise operating system.
    - Install added applications, roles, and features.
    - Update the operating system using Windows Update (or WSUS if optionally specified).
    - Stage Windows PE on the local disk.
    - Run System Preparation (Sysprep) and reboot into Windows PE.
    - Capture the installation to a Windows Imaging (WIM) file.
    - Turn off the virtual machine.

    This step requires from 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the speed of the Hyper-V host and your network's download speed. After some time, you will have a Windows 10 Enterprise x64 image that is fully patched and has run through Sysprep. The image is located in the C:\MDTBuildLab\Captures folder on SRV1. The file name is **REFW10X64-001.wim**. 

## Add a Windows 10 operating system image

    Start-VM PC4
    vmconnect localhost PC4
    ```

Problems here, first I got UEFI compatible not found
I tried stopping WDSServer and this caused nothing to be found
Now I'm having difficulty starting WDSServer again...

If I change to gen 1, it is loading PS100006.wim but I must press F12
Seems to be the correct image
And it popped up with contoso and asked me for the password
Ugh.. I got program files for PS100001 cannot be located on a distribution point again.

2. Press ENTER when prompted to start the network boot service.

3. In the Task Sequence Wizard, provide the password: pass@word1, and then click Next.

4. The Windows 10 Enterprise x64 task sequence is selected, click Next.

- ok I have an error that PS100001 cannot be located on a distribution point.
- I tried going to content status and this seems to bhe the USMT and it says it is successfully distributed
- I tried software library, boot images, and distribute these - this didn't help
- I tried software library, application management, packages, distribute content but the distributon point isn't showing up. This is likely the problem.

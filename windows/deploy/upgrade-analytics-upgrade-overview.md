# Upgrade Analytics - Upgrade overview

The first blade in the Upgrade Analytics solution is the **UPGRADE OVERVIEW** blade. This blade displays the total count of computers sharing data with Microsoft, and the count of computers upgraded. As you successfully upgrade computers, the count of computers upgraded increases.

Check this blade for data refresh status, including the date and time of the most recent data update and whether user changes are reflected. If a user change is pending when changing the upgrade assessment or importance level of an application or driver, **Data refresh pending** is displayed in orange. User changes are processed once every 24 hours and read **Up to date** in green when there are no pending changes.

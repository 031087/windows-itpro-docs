# Technical support policy for lost or forgotten passwords

For your protection, Microsoft takes security seriously. Microsoft accounts, the Windows operating system, and other Microsoft products include passwords to help secure your information. This article provides some options you can try to reset or recover your password if you’ve forgotten it. However, if these options don’t work, Microsoft support engineers can't help you retrieve or circumvent a lost or forgotten password.

If you lose or forget a password, you can use the links in this article to find published support information that will help you reset the password.

## How to reset a password for my domain account

If you are using a domain account, contact your IT administrator or helpdesk. For more information, see [Change or reset your Windows password](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4490115).

## How to reset a password for my Microsoft account

Please use this form for lost/forgotten passwords for your Microsoft Account: https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx

If you have forgotten your security proofs, or no longer have access to them anymore, then you will need to use the link above still. When you get to the security proofs part, you will have to select "I no longer have these anymore" and fill out a form for the Microsoft Account team.

You do need to provide as much information as possible. They will review the information you have provided and judge whether or not you are the account holder. Any action they take is not anything we can influence here, so please do not take it out on us, or others, when they refuse to provide a password reset link.

## How to reset a hardware BIOS password

Contact your manufacturer for their help and support. If you do this online, be sure to visit the manufacturer's site and not that of some third party.

## How to reset a password for an individual file

Some applications have the ability to password-protect individual files. Unless the application has a password reset ability included, these passwords can’t be recovered. Microsoft support engineers cannot help you retrieve or circumvent passwords that are lost or forgotten.

## Using third-party password tools

Some third-party companies claim to be able to circumvent passwords that have been applied to files and features that Microsoft programs use. For legal reasons, we cannot recommend or endorse any one of these companies. If you want help to break or to reset a password, you can locate and contact a third-party company for this help. You use such third-party products and services at your own risk.

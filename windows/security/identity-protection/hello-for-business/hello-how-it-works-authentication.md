# Windows Hello for Business and Authentication

Windows Hello for Business authentication is passwordless, two-factor authentication.  Authenticating with Windows Hello for Business provides a convenient sign-in experience that authenticates the user to both Azure Active Directory and Active Directory resources.<br>
Azure Active Directory joined devices authenticate to Azure during sign-in and can optionaly authenticate to Active Directory.  Hybrid Azure Active Directory joined devices authenticate to Active Directory during sign-in, and authenticate to Azure Active Directory in the background.<br>

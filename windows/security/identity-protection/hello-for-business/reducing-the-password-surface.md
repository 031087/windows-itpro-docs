# Password-less Strategy

Over the past few years, Microsoft has continued their commitment to enabling a world without passwords. At Microsoft Ignite 2017, we shared our four-step approach to password-less.

A Strategy and tangible next steps on how to take your enterprise password-less


User Promise
Users never deal with passwords in their day-to-day work flows

Security Promise
Credentials cannot be cracked, breached, or phished.

1. Develop a password replacement offering
2. Reduce user-visible password surface area
3. Transition into a password-less deployment (Pilot and test) Simulate (End user promise)
4. Eliminate passwords from the identity directory (achieved security promise)

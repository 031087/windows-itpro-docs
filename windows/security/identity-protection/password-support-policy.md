# Technical support policy for lost or forgotten passwords

Microsoft takes security seriously. This is for your protection Microsoft accounts, the Windows operating system, and other Microsoft products include passwords to help secure your information. This article provides some options you can use to reset or recover your password if you’ve forgotten it. However, if these options don’t work, Microsoft support engineers can't help you retrieve or circumvent a lost or forgotten password.

After you select this option, fill out a form for the Microsoft Account team. Provide as much information as you can on this form. The Microsoft Account team reviews the information that you provide to determine whether you are the account holder. This decision is final and Microsoft does not influence the team's choice of action.

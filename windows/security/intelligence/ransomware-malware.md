# Ransomware

Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files and folders, preventing access to important files. Ransomware attempts to extort money from victims by asking for money, usually in form of cryptocurrencies, in exchange for the decryption key. But cybercriminals won't always follow through and unlock your files.  

The trend towards increasingly sophisticated malware behavior, highlighted by the use of exploits and other attack vectors, makes older platforms especially susceptible to ransomware attacks.

## How ransomware works

Most ransomware infections start with:

- Email messages with attachments that try to install ransomware.

- Websites hosting exploit kits that attempt to use vulnerabilities in web browsers and other software to install ransomware.

More recent ransomware have [worm-like](worms-malware.md) capabilities that enable them to spread to other computers in the network. For example, Spora drops ransomware copies in network shares. WannaCrypt exploits the Server Message Block (SMB) vulnerability CVE-2017-0144 (also called EternalBlue) to infect other computers. A Petya variant exploits the same vulnerability, in addition to CVE-2017-0145 (also known as EternalRomance), and uses stolen credentials to move laterally across networks.

Once ransomware infects a device, it starts encrypting files, folders, entire hard drive partitions using encryption algorithms like RSA or RC4.

### Examples

Ransomware like Cerber and Locky search for and encrypt specific file types, typically document and media files. When the encryption is complete, the malware leaves a ransom note using text, image, or an HTML file with instructions to pay a ransom  to recover files.

More sophisticated ransomware like Spora, WannaCrypt (also known as WannaCry), and Petya (also known as NotPetya) include other capabilities, such as spreading to other computers via network shares or exploits.

Bad Rabbit ransomware was discovered attempting to spread across networks using hardcoded usernames and passwords in brute force attacks.

Older ransomware like Reveton locks screens instead of encrypting files. They display a full screen image and then disable Task Manager. The files are safe, but they are effectively inaccessible. The image usually contains a message claiming to be from law enforcement that says the computer has been used in illegal cybercriminal activities and fine needs to be paid. Because of this, Reveton is nicknamed "Police Trojan" or "Police ransomware".

Ransomware is one of the most lucrative revenue channels for cybercriminals, so malware authors continually improve their malware code to better target enterprise environments. Ransomware-as-a-Service is a cybercriminal business model in which malware creators sell their ransomware and other services to cybercriminals, who then operate the ransomware attacks. The business model also defines profit sharing between the malware creators, ransomware operators, and other parties that may be involved. For cybercriminals, ransomware is a big business, at the expense of individuals and businesses.

## How to protect against ransomware

 Organizations can be targeted specifically by attackers, or they can be caught in the wide net cast by cybercriminal operations. Large organizations are high value targets and attackers can demand bigger ransoms.

We recommend:

- Back up important files regularly. Use the 3-2-1 rule. Keep three backups of your data, on two different storage types, and at least one backup offsite.  

- Apply the latest updates to your operating systems and apps.

- Educate your employees so they can identify social engineering and spear-phishing attacks.

Microsoft provides comprehensive security capabilities that help protect against threats such as ransomware. We recommend:

- [Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/#pivot=itadmin&panel=it-security) includes Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security. These resources power productivity while providing intelligent security across users, devices, and data.

- [Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/exchange-online-advanced-threat-protection-service-description.aspx) includes machine learning capabilities that block dangerous emails, including millions of emails carrying ransomware downloaders.

- [OneDrive for Business](https://support.office.com/article/restore-a-previous-version-of-a-file-in-onedrive-159cad6d-d76e-4981-88ef-de6e96c93893?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) can back up files, which you would then use to restore files in the event of an infection.

- [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection) provides comprehensive endpoint protection, detection, and response capabilities to help prevent ransomware. In the event of a breach, Windows Defender ATP alerts security operations teams about suspicious activities and automatically attempts to resolve the problem. This includes alerts for suspicious PowerShell commands, connecting to a TOR website, launching self-replicated copies, and deletion of volume shadow copies. Try Windows Defender ATP free of charge.

- [Windows Defender Antivirus](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/windows-defender-antivirus-in-windows-10) is built into Windows 10 and, when enabled, provides real-time cloud-powered protection against threats. Keep Windows Defender Antivirus and other software up-to-date to get the latest protections.

- [Microsoft Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/deploy/index) browser protects against threats such as ransomware by preventing exploit kits from running. By using Microsoft [SmartScreen](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/deploy/index), Microsoft Edge blocks access to malicious websites.

- [Windows Defender Application Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-guard/wd-app-guard-overview) helps  protect your employees from untrusted sites by opening the site in an isolated Hyper-V-enabled container, separate from the host operating system.

- [Controlled folder access](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/enable-controlled-folders-exploit-guard) stops ransomware in its tracks by preventing unauthorized access to your important files. Controlled folder access locks down folders, allowing only authorized apps to access files. Unauthorized apps, including ransomware and other malicious executable files, DLLs, and scripts are denied access.

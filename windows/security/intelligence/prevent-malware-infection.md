## Security solutions

[Windows Defender Antivirus](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/comprehensive-security?ocid=cx-wdsi-articles) provides comprehensive protection through real-time detection and removal of malware using next-gen antimalware technologies. It uses the cloud, machine learning, and behavior analysis to rapidly respond to emerging threats.

For effective antimalware protection, enable Windows Defender Antivirus and keep it up-to-date with [automatic Microsoft Updates](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12373/windows-update-faq). To enable next-gen protection:

1. Search for **Windows Defender Security Center** to open the app.
2. Go to **Virus & threat protection**.
3. Make sure the switches for **Cloud-delivered protection** and **Automatic sample submission** are set to **On**.

Windows Defender Antivirus is built into Windows 10 and Windows 8.1. If your computer is running Windows 7 or earlier, you can download and use [Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/14210/security-essentials-download).

For increased protection, Windows Defender Firewall blocks unwanted inbound network connections. It can also control which applications on your computer can initiate outbound connections and can warn of malware suddenly trying to establish a remote connection.

Read the articles below to learn how turn on Windows Defender Firewall:

* [Turn on the Windows Firewall in Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4028544/windows-turn-windows-firewall-on-or-off)
* [Turn on the Windows Firewall in Windows 8.1 or Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17228/windows-protect-my-pc-from-viruses)

With Windows 10, you also benefit from [Windows Defender Exploit Guard](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2017/10/23/windows-defender-exploit-guard-reduce-the-attack-surface-against-next-generation-malware/), which protects files in key folders with Controlled folder access. Enterprise users are also provided broad or strategic exploit protection, reduction of attack surfaces with behavior detection rules, and reputation-based filtering of network connections.

### Additional protection for enterprises

In enterprise settings, phishing emails and other forms of phishing attacks may be the entry point for a larger cyberattack or espionage. The following technologies can help protect you from malware and other attacks that may arise from phishing:

* Windows Defender Exploit Guard is a new set of host intrusion prevention capabilities for Windows 10, allowing you to manage and reduce the attack surface of apps used by your employees. Windows Defender Exploit Guard utilizes the capabilities of the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph (ISG) to protect organizations from advanced threats, including zero-day exploits. The four components of Windows Defender Exploit Guard are:
  * Attack Surface Reduction (ASR): A set of controls that enterprises can enable to prevent malware from getting on the machine by blocking Office-, script-, and email-based threats
  * Network protection: Protects the endpoint against web-based threats by blocking any outbound process on the device to untrusted hosts/IP through Windows Defender SmartScreen
  * Controlled folder access: Protects sensitive data from ransomware by blocking untrusted processes from accessing your protected folders
  * Exploit protection: A set of exploit mitigations (replacing EMET) that can be easily configured to protect your system and applications

* Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is a security service that enables enterprise customers to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats on their networks. Windows Defender ATP  uses the following combination of technology built into Windows 10 and Microsoft's robust cloud service:
  * Endpoint behavioral sensors: Embedded in Windows 10, these sensors collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system (for example, process, registry, file, and network communications) and sends this sensor data to your private, isolated, cloud instance of Windows Defender ATP.
  * Cloud security analytics: Leveraging big-data, machine-learning, and unique Microsoft optics across the Windows ecosystem.
  * Threat intelligence: Generated by Microsoft hunters, security teams, and augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners, threat intelligence enables Windows Defender ATP to identify attacker tools, techniques, and procedures, and generate alerts when these are observed in collected sensor data.

## Keep software up-to-date

[Exploits](exploits-malware.md) typically abuse vulnerabilities in popular software such as web browsers, Java, Adobe Flash Player, and Microsoft Office. To protect your PC from exploits, always keep software up-to-date.

To keep Microsoft software up to date, ensure that [automatic Microsoft Updates](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12373/windows-update-faq) are enabled. Also, by upgrading to the latest version of Windows, you automatically benefit from a host of built-in security enhancements.

## Watch out for threats on email or instant messaging

Email and other messaging tools are a few of the most common ways your PC can get infected. Attachments or links on messages can open malware directly or can stealthily trigger a download. Some emails will instruct you to allow macros or other executable content—these instructions are designed to make it easier for malware to infect your computer.

To avoid threats that arrive via email or other messaging tools:

* Learn to identify suspicious messages. Never open attachments or links in suspicious looking messages.

* Exercise caution when dealing with messages received from unknown sources or received unexpectedly from known sources.

* Use extreme caution when accepting file transfers.

* Social engineering attacks often use email as a way of gaining access to your personal information. Emails that request personal information or require you to access third-party sites might be part of social engineering attacks. Always use caution when providing personal or credential information.

* If you receive a notification from your bank or credit card company requiring immediate action, contact your bank or credit card company using contact information on their official website. Do not use links, email addresses, or phone numbers in the suspicious email.

* Use an email service that provides protection against malicious attachments, links, and abusive senders. [Microsoft Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/Anti-spam-and-anti-malware-protection-in-Office-365-5ce5cf47-2120-4e51-a403-426a13358b7e) has built-in antimalware, link protection, and spam filtering, helping protect you from malware, phishing, and other email threats.

### What are suspicious messages?

Here are some characteristics that you can use to spot potentially harmful messages:

* The message is unexpected and unsolicited. If you suddenly receive an email from an entity or a person you rarely deal with, consider this email suspect.

* The message or the attachment asks you to enable macros, adjust security settings, or install applications. Normal emails will not ask you to do this.

* The message contains errors. Legitimate corporate messages are less likely to have typographic or grammatical errors or contain wrong information.

* The sender address does not match the signature on the message itself. For example, an email is purported to be from Mary of Contoso Corp, but the sender address is john<span></span>@example.com.

* There are multiple recipients in the “To” field and they appear to be random addresses. Corporate messages are normally sent directly to individual recipients.

* The greeting on the message itself does not personally address you. Apart from messages that mistakenly address a different person, those that misuse your name or pull your name directly from your email address tend to be malicious.

* URLs behind links do not match the link text. Try hovering over links to check if they point to a sensible URL. In some cases, malicious URLs are completely off and even point to completely unrelated domains.

## Browse the web safely

The web is filled with useful and helpful content that we use every day. While there are billions of helpful pages, the web also contains sites that have been intentionally set up for malicious purpose. Some legitimate sites also get compromised—they are modified by attackers to deliver malware and other malicious content.

By visiting malicious or compromised sites, your PC can get infected with malware automatically or you can get tricked into downloading and installing malware. To avoid malware that are distributed through these websites:

* Do not click links in suspicious messages you received in email or other messaging services. See the tips above about identifying suspicious messages.

* Learn to spot spoofed or fake websites.

* Avoid sites that are likely to contain malware.

### How do I spot suspicious websites?

Check for the following characteristics to identify potentially harmful websites:

* Check the URL in the address bar. The initial part or the domain should represent the company that owns the site you are visiting. Check the domain for misspellings. For example, malicious sites commonly use domain names that swap the letter O with a zero (0) or the letters L and I with a one (1). If example<span></span>.com is spelled examp1e<span></span>.com, the site you are visiting is suspect.

* Sites that contain adult or pirated content are common vectors for spreading malware. Users do not openly discuss visits to these sites, so any untoward experience are more likely to stay unreported.

* Sites that aggressively open popups and display misleading buttons. Many of these sites trick users into accepting content through constant popups or mislabeled buttons. For example, some of these sites display media play buttons to trick users into downloading and installing infected media players.

To block malicious websites, use a modern web browser like [Microsoft Edge](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/microsoft-edge?ocid=cx-wdsi-articles) which uses Windows Defender SmartScreen to identify phishing and malware websites. Microsoft Edge also works with Windows Defender Antivirus to check downloads for malware.

For optimal protection while browsing websites, use [Windows Defender Application Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-guard/wd-app-guard-overview?ocid=cx-wdsi-articles). Application Guard helps to isolate untrusted sites, protecting you while you browse the Internet. If you browse an untrusted site through either Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer, Application Guard opens the site in a virtualized container that is separate from the host operating system. This container isolation means that if the untrusted site turns out to be malicious, the host PC is protected and the attacker can't get to your data. Application Guard is available on enterprise editions of Windows 10 version 1709 or above.

If you encounter an unsafe site, click **More […] > Send feedback** on Microsoft Edge. You can also [report unsafe sites directly to Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/wdsi/support/report-unsafe-site).

## Stay away from pirated material

Using pirated content is not only illegal, it can also expose your PC to malware. Sites that offer pirated software and media are also often used to distribute malware. Many illicit media download and streaming sites try to push infected media players and codecs packages. Some of these sites can automatically install malware to visiting computers.

Pirated software is often bundled with malware and other unwanted software, including intrusive browser plugins and adware.
To stay safe, download movies, music, and apps from official publisher websites or stores. Consider running a streamlined OS such as [Windows 10 Pro SKU S Mode](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-10-s?ocid=cx-wdsi-articles), which ensures that only vetted apps from the Windows Store are installed.

## Don't attach unfamiliar removable drives

Some types of malware can spread by copying themselves to USB flash drives or other removable drives. Also, there are malicious individuals that intentionally prepare and distribute infected drives—leaving these drives in public places to victimize unsuspecting individuals.

Only use removable drives that you are familiar with or that come from a trusted source. If a drive has been used in publicly accessible devices, like computers in a café or a library, make sure you have antimalware running on your computer before you use the drive. Avoid opening unfamiliar files you find on suspect drives, including Office and PDF documents and executable files.

## Use a non-administrator account

At the time they are launched, whether inadvertently by a user or automatically, most malware run under the same privileges as the active user. This means that by limiting your own privileges, you can prevent malware from making consequential changes to your computer.

By default, Windows uses [User Account Control (UAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/access-protection/user-account-control/user-account-control-overview) to provide automatic, granular control of privileges—it temporarily restricts privileges and prompts the active user every time an application attempts to make potentially consequential changes to the system. Although UAC helps limit the privileges of admin users, users can simply override this restriction when prompted. As a result, it is quite easy for an admin user to inadvertently allow malware to run.

To help ensure that your everyday activities do not result in malware infection and other potentially catastrophic changes, you can use a non-administrator account for regular use. By using a non-administrator account, you can prevent installation of unauthorized apps and prevent inadvertent changes to system settings. Avoid browsing the web or checking email using an account with administrator privileges.

Whenever necessary, you can log in as an administrator to install apps or make configuration changes that require admin privileges.

[Read about creating user accounts and giving administrator privileges](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10)

## Other safety tips

To further ensure that your data is protected from malware as well as other threats, make sure you:

* Backup your files. Follow the 3-2-1 rule: make **3 copies**, store in at least **2 locations**, with at least **1 offline copy**. You can use [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/?ocid=cx-wdsi-articles) for reliable cloud-based copies that allow you to access your files from multiple devices and help you recover damaged or lost files, including files locked by ransomware.

* Be wary when connecting to public hotspots, particularly those that do not require authentication.

* Use [strong passwords](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12410/microsoft-account-help-protect-account) and enable multi-factor authentication.

* Do not use untrusted devices to log on to email, social media, and corporate accounts.

* Monitor and safeguard your [family’s online computing experience](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4013209/windows-10-protect-your-family-online-in-windows-defender).

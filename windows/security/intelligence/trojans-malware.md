# Trojan malware

Trojans are a common type of malware which, unlike viruses, canâ€™t spread on their own. This means they either have to be downloaded manually or another malware needs to download and install them.

Trojans often use the same file names as real and legitimate apps. You might accidentally download a trojan thinking you are downloading a legitimate app.

## How trojans work

Trojans can come in many different varieties, but generally they do the following:

- Download and install other malware, such as viruses or worms.

- Use your PC for click fraud.

- Record your keystrokes and the sites you visit.

- Send information about your PC to a malicious hacker including passwords, login details for websites, and browsing history.

- Give a malicious hacker control over your PC.

## How to protect against trojans

Use the following free Microsoft software to detect and remove it:

- Windows Defender Antivirus for Windows 10 and Windows 8.1, or Microsoft Security Essentials for  previous versions of Windows.

- Microsoft Safety Scanner

You should also run a full scan. A full scan might find other, hidden malware.

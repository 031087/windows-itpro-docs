# Rootkits

Malware authors use rootkits to hide malware on your device, allowing malware to persist on your device as long as possible. A successful rootkit can potentially remain in place for years if it is undetected. During this time it will steal information and resources from your PC.

## How rootkits work

Rootkits intercepts and change standard operating system processes. After a rootkit infects a device, you can’t trust any information that device reports about itself.

For example, if you were to ask your PC to list all of the programs that are running, the rootkit might stealthily remove any programs it doesn’t want you to know about. Rootkits are all about hiding things. They want to hide themselves on your PC, and they want to hide malicious activity on your PC.

Many modern malware families use rootkits to try and avoid detection and removal, including:

## How to protect against rootkits

Like any other type of malware, the best way to avoid rootkits is to prevent it from being installed in the first place.

- Update your software.

- Use security software to protect your device. Windows Defender Antivirus is included with Windows 10 and provides real-time detection and removal of malware.

- Be wary of suspicious websites and emails.

### What if I think I have a rootkit on my PC?

Microsoft security software includes a number of technologies designed specifically to remove rootkits. If you think you might have a rootkit on your PC, and your antimalware software isn’t detecting it, you might need an extra tool that lets you boot to a known trusted environment.
In this case, use [Windows Defender Offline](http://windows.microsoft.com/windows/what-is-windows-defender-offline).
Windows Defender Offline is a standalone tool that has the latest anti-malware updates from Microsoft. It’s designed to be used on PCs that aren't working correctly due to a possible malware infection.

### What if I can’t remove a rootkit?

If the problem persists, we strongly recommend that you reinstall your operating system and your security software. You should then restore your data from backup.

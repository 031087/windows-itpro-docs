# Transparency Reports

The Windows Defender ATP team is committed to delivering industry-leading protection, customer choice, and transparency on the quality of our solutions. We release transparency reports to help our customers and the broader security community to stay informed and understand independent test results better.

## History

[Starting in 2015](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2018/03/22/why-windows-defender-antivirus-is-the-most-deployed-in-the-enterprise/) our results in two major independent tests ([AV-Comparatives](https://www.av-comparatives.org/) and [AV-TEST](https://www.av-test.org/)) began to improve dramatically. Simply put, we completely redesigned our antivirus solutions for both Windows 7 and Windows 10 from the ground up.

Microsoft has worked hard to make our [Windows Defender Antivirus](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/windows-defender-antivirus-in-windows-10) capabilities increasingly more effective by utilizing heuristic detections, machine learning, behavioral analysis, and other evolutions. By removing dependency on constant input from researchers, our antivirus solution can block nearly all malware at first sight and in milliseconds.

The time and effort Microsoft puts into improving Windows Defender Antivirus continues to show in the form of consistently high scores from independent tests.

### Scores

* In March 2015 our scores on the AV-TEST Prevalence Test averaged **85%**. Over the next 5 months the score would rapidly increase.

* By August 2015 it was **100%**. Since then, weâ€™ve averaged that type of score (or extremely close) consistently.

* In December 2017 we achieved a **perfect score** across both the AV-TEST Prevalence and Real-World based tests. Previously we had only scored a perfect 100% on one of the two tests for a given month.

* Starting at the end of 2017 and going into 2018, we consistently **detect all malware samples** in the AV Real World Protection test

## Factors not represented in the tests

It is important to remember that [Windows Defender ATP](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc) (which integrates our antivirus capabilities and the whole Windows security stack) provides a much larger set of protection features that are not factored into the tests. These features provide **additional layers of protection** that help prevent malware from getting onto devices in the first place:

* [Windows Defender System Guard](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2017/10/23/hardening-the-system-and-maintaining-integrity-with-windows-defender-system-guard/)

* [Windows Defender Application Guard](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2017/10/23/making-microsoft-edge-the-most-secure-browser-with-windows-defender-application-guard/)

* [Windows Defender Application Control](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2017/10/23/introducing-windows-defender-application-control/)

* [Windows Defender Exploit Guard](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2017/10/23/windows-defender-exploit-guard-reduce-the-attack-surface-against-next-generation-malware/)

If organizations like AV-Comparatives and AV-TEST performed testing against the complete endpoint protection solution, the results would better represent the kind of protection our customers actually enjoy daily.

 To see these capabilities for yourself sign up for a [90-day trial of Windows Defender ATP](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc) today, or [enable Preview features on existing tenants](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/preview-settings-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection).

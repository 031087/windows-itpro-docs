# Top scoring in industry antivirus tests

Antivirus capabilities in Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) **consistently receives high scores** from independent tests, making it a top choice in the antivirus market. That is because Microsoft has built the most secure version of its platform in Windows 10, making it much more difficult for exploits, malware, and other threats to infect devices.

Windows Defender ATP [next generation protection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xy3MOxkX_o4) detects and stops malware at first sight by using a model that leverages predictive technologies, [machine learning](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2018/06/07/machine-learning-vs-social-engineering/), [artificial intelligence](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2018/02/14/how-artificial-intelligence-stopped-an-emotet-outbreak/), behavioral analysis, and other evolutions. That is why it [is the most deployed in the enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/windows-defender-antivirus-in-windows-10).

Millions of devices are protected from malware outbreaks and cyberattacks every day, sometimes [milliseconds after a campaign starts](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2018/03/07/behavior-monitoring-combined-with-machine-learning-spoils-a-massive-dofoil-coin-mining-campaign/). In many cases, customers may not even know they were protected.

The excellent results on independent industry tests is just one indication of quality we provide.

## AV-TEST

AV-TEST is an independent IT security institute from Germany and has been testing internationally relevant IT security products for over 15 years.

The AV-TEST Product Review and Certification Report tests on three categories: protection, performance, and usability. The scores listed below are for the protection category against malware infections which has two scores, the AV-Test reference set (known as just "prevalent malware") and the real world testing.

**Real-world testing** refers to protection against 0-day malware attacks, inclusive of web and e-mail threats.

**Prevalent malware** refers to detection of widespread and prevalent malware discovered in the last 4 weeks.

|2018 |January - February | March - April | May - June|
|-----|-----|-----|-----| 
|Real World detection rate| 100.00%, 100.00%| 98.00%, 100.00%| 100.00%, 100.00%|
|Prevalent Malware detection rate| 99.92%, 100.00%|100.00%, 100.00%|100.00%, 100.00%|

## AV Comparatives

AV-Comparatives is an independent organization offering systematic testing for security software such as PC/Mac-based antivirus products and mobile security solutions.

The  **Real-World Protection Test (Enterprise)** evaluates the “real-world” protection capabilities with default settings. The goal is to find out whether the security software protects the computer by either hindering the malware from changing any systems or remediating all changes if any were made.

The **Malware Protection Test Enterprise** assesses a security program’s ability to protect a system against infection by malicious files before, during or after execution. It is only tested every six months.

The **blocked** category tests whether malware was successfully blocked by AV.

|2018| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apr. | May | Jun. |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Real World (blocked) | No test| 100.00% | 94.40% | 96.40% | 100.00%| 99.50%|
|Malware protection (blocked)| No test | No test | 99.90% | No test | No test | No test |

## Factors not represented in the tests

It is important to remember that [Windows Defender ATP](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc) (which integrates our antivirus capabilities and the whole Windows security stack) provides a much larger set of protection features that are not factored into the tests. These features provide [additional layers of protection](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2017/12/11/detonating-a-bad-rabbit-windows-defender-antivirus-and-layered-machine-learning-defenses/) that help prevent malware from getting onto devices in the first place.

 To see these capabilities for yourself sign up for a [90-day trial of Windows Defender ATP](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc) today, or [enable Preview features on existing tenants](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/preview-settings-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection).

The attack surface reduction set of capabilities provide the first line of defense in the stack. By ensuring configuration settings are properly set and exploit mitigation techniques are applied, these set of capabilities resist attacks and exploitations. 

To further reinforce the security perimeter of your network, Windows Defender ATP uses next generation protection designed to catch all types of emerging threats.

Endpoint detection and response capabilities are put in place to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats that may have made it past the first two security security pillars. 

In conjunction with being able to quickly respond to advanced attacks, Windows Defender ATP offers automatic investigation and remediation capabilities that help reduce the volume of alerts in minutes at scale. 

Windows Defender ATP also provides a security posture capability to help you dynamically assess the security state of your enterprise network, identify unprotected systems, and take recommended actions to improve the overall security state of your network.

Advanced hunting gives you the flexibility of using a powerful search and query tool to proactively hunt for possible threats accross your organization.

# What's new in User Account Control?


**Applies to**

-   Windows 10

User Account Control (UAC) helps prevent malware from damaging a computer and helps organizations deploy a better-managed desktop environment.

In Windows 10, User Account Control has added some improvements.

## New features in Windows 10


-   **Integration with the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI)**. The [AMSI](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn889587.aspx) scans all UAC elevation requests for malware. If malware is detected, the admin privilege is blocked.

# What's new in Trusted Platform Module?


**Applies to**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 10 Mobile

This topic for the IT professional describes new features for the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) in Windows 10.

## New features in Windows 10, Version 1511


-   Key Storage Providers (KSPs) and srvcrypt support elliptical curve cryptography (ECC).

## New features in Windows 10


The following sections describe the new and changed functionality in the TPM for Windows 10:

-   [Device health attestation](#BKMK_DHA)
-   [Microsoft Passport](microsoft-passport.md) support
-   [Device Guard](device-guard-overview.md) support
-   [Credential Guard](credential-guard.md) support

## Device health attestation


Device health attestation enables enterprises to establish trust based on hardware and software components of a managed device. With device heath attestation, you can configure an MDM server to query a health attestation service that will allow or deny a managed device access to a secure resource.

Some things that you can check on the device are:

-   Is Data Execution Prevention supported and enabled?
-   Is BitLocker Drive Encryption supported and enabled?
-   Is SecureBoot supported and enabled?

**Note**  The device must be running Windows 10 and it must support at least TPM 2.0.

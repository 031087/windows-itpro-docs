### Windows 10 Subscription Activation

Windows 10 Education support has been added to Windows 10 Subscription Activation.
With Windows 10, version 1903, you can step-up from Windows 10 Pro Education to the enterprise-grade edition for educational institutions – Windows 10 Education. For more information, see [Windows 10 Subscription Activation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/windows-10-subscription-activation).

### SetupDiag

[SetupDiag](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/upgrade/setupdiag) version 1.4.1 is available.

SetupDiag is a command-line tool that can help diagnose why a Windows 10 update failed. SetupDiag works by searching Windows Setup log files. When searching log files, SetupDiag uses a set of rules to match known issues. In the current version of SetupDiag there are 53 rules contained in the rules.xml file, which is extracted when SetupDiag is run. The rules.xml file will be updated as new versions of SetupDiag are made available. 

## Windows Update

- **Fewer interruptions**: Now you have the option to let Windows Update adjust active hours based on your device-specific usage patterns.
    - You must enable the intelligent active hours feature for the system to predict device-specific usage patterns.   
- **Press pause**: Updates can come at inconvenient times. So, now you’ll be able to pause both feature and monthly updates for up to 35 days (seven days at a time, up to five times).
    - Once the 35-day pause period is reached, you will need to update your device before pausing again. 
- **New notifications**: When there’s an update requiring you to restart your device, you’ll see a colored dot on the Power button in the Start menu and on the Windows icon in your taskbar.

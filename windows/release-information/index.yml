      Microsoft has updated its servicing model. The Semi-Annual Channel (SAC) offers twice-per-year feature updates that release around March and September, with an 18-month servicing period for each release. Starting with Windows 10, version 1809, feature updates for Windows 10 Enterprise and Education editions with a targeted release month of September will be serviced for 30 months from their release date (more information can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/2018/09/06/helping-customers-shift-to-a-modern-desktop/)).
      <br>&nbsp;
      <br>If you are not using Windows Update for Business today, “Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted)” (SAC-T) has no impact on your devices (more information can be found [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-IT-Pro-Blog/Windows-10-and-the-disappearing-SAC-T/ba-p/199747)), and we recommend you begin deployment of each Semi-Annual Channel release right away to devices selected for early adoption and ramp up to full deployment at your discretion. This will enable you to gain access to new features, experiences, and integrated security as soon as possible.
      <br>&nbsp;
      <br>If you are using Windows Update for Business today, refer to the table below to understand when your device will be updated, based on which deferral period you have configured, SAC -T or SAC.
      <br>&nbsp;
      <br><b>Notice: November 13, 2018:</b> All editions of Windows 10 October 2018 Update, version 1809, for Windows client and server have resumed. Customers currently running Windows 10, version 1809, will receive build 17763.134 as part of our regularly scheduled Update Tuesday servicing in November. If you update to the Window 10, version 1809, feature update you will receive build 17763.107.

      <br>&nbsp;
      <br>November 13 marks the revised start of the servicing timeline for the Semi-Annual Channel ('Targeted') and Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) release for Windows 10, version 1809, Windows Server 2019, and Windows Server, version 1809.

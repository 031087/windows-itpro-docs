## In this topic

- [What is MDT](#what-is-mdt) provides a brief overview of MDT.
- [The proof of concept environment](#proof-of-concept-environment) used in this guide is described. 
- [Sample files](#sample-files) are provided to help you put the information you learn into practice more quickly.

## What is MDT

MDT is a unified collection of tools, processes, and guidance for automating desktop and server deployment. In addition to reducing deployment time and standardizing desktop and server images, MDT enables you to more easily manage security and ongoing configurations. MDT builds on top of the core deployment tools in the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK) with additional guidance and features designed to reduce the complexity and time required for deployment in an enterprise environment.

MDT supports the deployment of Windows 10, as well as Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server. It also includes support for zero-touch installation (ZTI) with Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager.

See [Get started with the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT)](get-started-with-the-microsoft-deployment-toolkit.md) for more details, including a description of many of the key features and options available in MDT. A list of components that support Lite Touch Installation (LTI) is also provided.

To download the latest version of MDT, visit the [MDT resource page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=618117).

## Proof-of-concept environment

For the purposes of this guide we will use the following servers and client machines: DC01, MDT01, CM01, PC0001, and PC0002.

![computers](../images/mdt-01-fig01.png)

DC01 is a domain controller; the other servers and client machines are members of the domain contoso.com for the fictitious Contoso Corporation.

## Hypervisor requirement

In addition to the servers and clients used in this lab, a Hyper-V host is also required to build a Windows 10 reference image. If you do not have access to a Hyper-V server, you can install Hyper-V on a Windows 10 or Windows 8.1 computer temporarily to use for this lab. For instructions on how to enable Hyper-V on Windows 10, see the [Verify support and install Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-10-poc#verify-support-and-install-hyper-v) section in the Windows 10 deployment test lab guide (this guide is a less detailed version of the current guide, but with more instructions for installing Hyper-V).

### Domain credentials

**Active Directory domain name**: contoso.com
**Domain administrator username**: admin
**Domain administrator password**: pass@word3 

### Server details

- **DC01.** A computer running Windows Server 2012 R2, fully patched with the latest security updates, and configured as an Active Directory Domain Controller, DNS Server, and (optionally) DHCP Server for the contoso.com domain.
  - Server name: DC01
  - IP Address: 10.169.5.147
  - Roles: DNS, DHCP, and domain controller
- **MDT01.** A computer running Windows Server 2012 R2, fully patched with the latest security updates, and configured as a member server in the contoso.com domain. This is an application server that is used to run MDT.
  - Server name: MDT01
  - IP Address: 10.169.5.148
  - Data drive D: with at least 100GB of free space.
- **CM01.** A computer running Windows Server 2012 R2, fully patched with the latest security updates, and configured as a member server in the contoso.com domain. This is a System Center Configuration Manager site server.
  - Server name: CM01
  - IP Address: 10.169.5.149
  - Data drive D: with at least 100GB of free space.

### Client details

- **PC0001.** A computer running Windows 10 Enterprise x64, fully patched with the latest security updates, and configured as a member in the contoso.com domain. This machine is referenced as the admin workstation.
  - Client name: PC0001
  - IP Address: DHCP
- **PC0002.** A computer running Windows 7 SP1 Enterprise x64, fully patched with the latest security updates, and configured as a member in the contoso.com domain. This machine is referenced during the migration scenarios.
  - Client name: PC0002
  - IP Address: DHCP
- **PC0003 - PC0007** These are other client computers similar to PC0001 and PC0002 that are used in the guide for various scenarios. The device names are incremented to avoid confusion. For example, PC0003 and PC0004 are running Windows 7 just like PC0002, but are used for Config Mgr refresh and replace scenarios, respectively.

### Network environment

For this lab, all server and client computers are on the same subnet. This is not required, but each server and client computer must be able to connect to each other, including resolution of all DNS names and Active Directory information for the contoso.com domain.  Internet connectivity is also requried to download OS and applicaton updates.

### Organizational unit structure

## Sample files

In order to help you put the information you learn into practice more quickly, we recommend that you download a small set of sample files for the fictitious Contoso Corporation:
-   [Gather.ps1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=619361). This sample Windows PowerShell script performs the MDT Gather process in a simulated MDT environment. This allows you to test the MDT gather process and check to see if it is working correctly without performing a full Windows deployment.
-   [Set-OUPermissions.ps1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=619362). This sample Windows PowerShell script creates a domain account and then configures OU permissions to allow the account to join machines to the domain in the specified OU.
-   [MDTSample.zip](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=619363). This sample web service shows you how to configure a computer name dynamically using MDT.

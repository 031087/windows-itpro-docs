# Adding devices to Windows Autopilot

**Applies to**

-   Windows 10

Before deploying a device using Windows Autopilot, the device must be registered with the Windows Autopilot deployment service. Ideally, this would be performed by the OEM, reseller, or distributor from which the devices were purchased, but this can also be done by the organization by collecting the hardware identity and uploading it manually.

## Device identification

To define a device to the Windows Autopilot deployment service, a unique hardware ID for the device needs to be captured and uploaded to the service. While this step is ideally done by the hardware vendor (OEM, reseller, or distributor), automatically associating the device with an organization, it is also possible to do this through a harvesting process that collects the device from within a running Windows 10 version 1703 or later installation.

The hardware ID, also commonly referred to as a hardware hash, contains several details about the device, including its manufacturer, model, device serial number, hard drive serial number, and many other attributes that can be used to uniquely identify that device.

Note that the hardware hash also contains details about when it was generated, so it will change each time it is generated. When the Windows Autopilot Deployment Service attempts to match a device, it considers changes like that, as well as more substantial changes such as a new hard drive, and is still able to match successfully. But substantial changes to the hardware, such as motherboard replacement, would not match, so the device would need to be re-uploaded.

## Collecting the hardware ID from existing devices using PowerShell

The hardware ID, or hardware hash, for an existing device is available through Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), as long as that device is running Windows 10 version 1703 or later. To help gather this information, as well as the serial number of the device (useful to see at a glance the machine to which it belongs), a PowerShell script called [Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo.ps1 has been published to the PowerShell Gallery website](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo).

To use this script, you can download it from the PowerShell Gallery and run it on each computer, or you can install it directly from the PowerShell Gallery. To install it directly and capture the hardware hash from the local computer, these commands can be used:

*md c:\\HWID*

*Set-Location c:\\HWID*

*Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted*

*Install-Script -Name Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo*

*Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo.ps1 -OutputFile AutoPilotHWID.csv*

You must run this PowerShell script with administrator privileges (elevated). It can also be run remotely, as long as WMI permissions are in place and WMI is accessible through the Windows Firewall on that remote computer. See the Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo script’s help (using “Get-Help Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo.ps1”) for more information.

>[!NOTE]
>With Windows 10 version 1803 and above, devices will download an Autopilot profile as soon as they connect to the internet. For devices that are not yet registered with the Autopilot deployment service, a profile will be downloaded that indicates the device should not be deployed using Autopilot. If the device connects to the internet as part of the collection process, you will need to reset the PC, reimage the PC, or re-generalize the OS (using sysprep /generalize /oobe).

## Collecting the hardware ID from existing devices using System Center Configuration Manager

Starting with System Center Configuration Manager current branch version 1802, the hardware hashes for existing Windows 10 version 1703 and higher devices are automatically collected by Configuration Manager. See the [What’s new in version 1802](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sccm/core/plan-design/changes/whats-new-in-version-1802#report-on-windows-autopilot-device-information) documentation for more details.

## Uploading hardware IDs

Once the hardware IDs have been captured from existing devices, they can be uploaded through a variety of means. See the detailed documentation for each available mechanism:

For guidance on how to register devices, configure and apply deployment profiles, follow one of the available administration options:

-   [Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/enrollment-autopilot)

-   [Microsoft Store for Business](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-store/add-profile-to-devices#manage-autopilot-deployment-profiles)

-   [Microsoft 365 Business & Office 365 Admin](https://support.office.com/article/Create-and-edit-AutoPilot-profiles-5cf7139e-cfa1-4765-8aad-001af1c74faa)

-   [Partner Center](https://msdn.microsoft.com/partner-center/autopilot)

For those using Microsoft Intune, devices should normally be uploaded via Intune; for those using Microsoft 365 Business, its administrative portal would be used. For [Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/en-us/partner/cloud-solution-provider) partners uploading devices on the behalf of a customer that they are authorized to manage, Partner Center can be used. For any other scenario, the Microsoft Store for Business is available.

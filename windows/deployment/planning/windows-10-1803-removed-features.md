# Features removed starting with Windows 10, version 1803

> Applies to: Windows 10, version 1803

Each release of Windows 10 adds new features and functionality; we also occasionally remove features and functionality, usually because we've added a better option. Here are the details about the features and functionalities that we removed in Windows 10, version 1803 (also called Windows 10 April 2018 Update).

For information about features that might be removed in a future release, see [Windows 10 deprecated features](windows-10-deprecated-features.md)

> [!TIP]
> - You can get early access to Windows 10 builds by joining the [Windows Insider program](https://insider.windows.com) - this is a great way to test feature changes.
- Have questions about other releases? Check out the information for [Features that are removed in Windows 10, version 1703](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/planning/windows-10-1703-removed-features), [Features that are removed in Windows 10, version 1709](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/planning/windows-10-1709-removed-features), and [Features that are removed in Windows 10 Creators Update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4014193/features-that-are-removed-or-deprecated-in-windows-10-creators-update).

**The list is subject to change and might not include every affected feature or functionality.** 

## Features we removed in this release

We've removed the following features and functionalities from the installed product image in Windows 10, version 1803. Applications or code that depend on these features won't function in this release unless you use an alternate method.   

|Feature	|Instead you can use...|
|-----------|--------------------
|Groove Music Pass|[We ended the Groove streaming music service and music track sales through the Microsoft Store in 2017](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4046109/groove-music-and-spotify-faq). The Groove app is being updated to reflect this change. You can still use Groove Music to play the music on your PC or to stream music from OneDrive. You can use Spotify or other music services to stream music on Windows 10, or to buy music to own.|
|People - Suggestions will no longer include unsaved contacts for non-Microsoft accounts|Manually save the contact details for people you send mail to or get mail from.|
|Language control in the Control Panel|	Use the Settings app to change your language settings.|
|HomeGroup|We are removing [HomeGroup](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17145) but not your ability to share printers, files, and folders.<br><br>When you update to Windows 10, version 1803, you won't see HomeGroup in File Explorer, the Control Panel, or Troubleshoot (**Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot**). Any printers, files, and folders that you shared using HomeGroup **will continue to be shared**.<br><br>Instead of using HomeGroup, you can now share printers, files and folders by using features that are built into Windows 10: <br>- [Share your network printer](https://www.bing.com/search?q=share+printer+windows+10) <br>- [Share files in File Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4027674/windows-10-share-files-in-file-explorer) |
|**Connect to suggested open hotspots** option in Wi-Fi settings |We previously [disabled the **Connect to suggested open hotspots** option](https://privacy.microsoft.com/windows-10-open-wi-fi-hotspots) and are now removing it from the Wi-Fi settings page. You can manually connect to free wireless hotspots with **Network & Internet** settings, from the taskbar or Control Panel, or by using Wi-Fi Settings (for mobile devices).|
|XPS Viewer|We're changing the way you get XPS Viewer. In Windows 10, version 1709 and earlier versions, the app is included in the installation image. If you have XPS Viewer and you update to Windows 10, version 1803, there's no action required. You'll still have XPS Viewer. <br><br>However, if you install Windows 10, version 1803, on a new device (or as a clean installation), you may need to [install XPS Viewer from **Apps and Features** in the Settings app](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/application-management/add-apps-and-features) or through [Features on Demand](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/features-on-demand-v2--capabilities). If you had XPS Viewer in Windows 10, version 1709, but manually removed it before updating, you'll need to manually reinstall it.|

# Features removed or planned for replacement starting with Windows 10, version 1903

> Applies to: Windows 10, version 1903

Each release of Windows 10 adds new features and functionality; occasionally we also remove features and functionality, usually because we've added a better option. Here are the details about the features and functionalities that we removed in Windows 10, version 1903. 

A great way to test feature changes is to join the [Windows Insider program](https://insider.windows.com), where you can get early access to new Windows 10 builds.

**The list is subject to change and might not include every affected feature or functionality.** 

## Features we removed or will remove soon

The following features and functionalities are removed from the installed product image for Windows 10, version 1903, or are planned for removal in an upcoming release. Applications or code that depend on these features won't function in this release unless you use another method.

## Features weâ€™re no longer developing

We're no longer actively developing these features and may remove them from a future update. Some features have been replaced with other features or functionality, while others are now available from different sources. 

If you have feedback about the proposed replacement of any of these features, you can use the [Feedback Hub app](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app).

|Windows To Go|Windows To Go is no longer being developed. The feature does not support feature updates and therefore does not enable you to stay current. It also requires a specific type of USB that is no longer supported by many OEM vendors.|

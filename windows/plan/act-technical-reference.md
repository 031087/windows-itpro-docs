# Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) Technical Reference


**Applies to**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 8.1

The Microsoft® Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) helps you determine whether the applications, devices, and computers in your organization are compatible with versions of the Windows® operating system.

By using ACT, you can obtain compatibility information from Microsoft and software vendors, identify compatibility issues within your own organization, and share compatibility ratings with other ACT users. The tools in ACT help you analyze and mitigate compatibility issues before you deploy a version of Windows to your organization.

ACT is available in the [Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK) for Windows 10](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=526740).

title: Identifying Computers for Inventory Collection (Windows 10)
description: To generate a complete inventory and obtain a comprehensive view of your organization, inventory all computers. However, remember that deploying inventory-collector packages to all computers in your organization will require the additional work of analyzing and reducing a larger list of applications. If you do not have the resources to deploy to all computers or you cannot process a larger list of applications, consider deploying inventory-collector packages to representative subsets of computers instead.

### CellData

Setting | Description
--- | ---
CellularFailover | Allow or disallow cellular data failover when in limited Wi-Fi connectivity. By default, if the phone is connected to a Wi-Fi network and the data connection to a site is unsuccessful due to limited Wi-Fi connectivity, the phone will complete the connection to the site using available cellular data networks (when possible) to provide an optimal user experience. When the customization is enabled, a user option to use or not use cellular data for limited Wi-Fi connectivity becomes visible in the **Settings** > **cellular+SIM** screen. This option is automatically set to **donâ€™t use cellular data** when the customization is enabled.
MaxNumberOfPDPContexts | Set a maximum value (1 through 4, inclusive, or 0x1 through 0x4 hexadecimal) for the number of simultaneous packet data protocol (PDP) contexts for 3GPP connections. By default, the OS enforces a maximum of four (4) simultaneous packet data protocol (PDP) contexts for 3GPP connections, and one (1) PDP context for 3GPP2 connections. You can set a different maximum value if required by their mobile operator. The same maximums apply for both roaming and non-roaming scenarios. This maximum does not include packet contexts used internally by the modem.
ModemProfiles > LTEAttachGuids | Set the value for LTEAttachGuid to the OemConnectionId GUID used for the LTE attach profile in the modem. The value is a GUID in the string format *XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX*.
PersistAtImaging > DisableAoAc | Enable or disable Always-on/Always-connected (AoAc) on the WWAN adapter.

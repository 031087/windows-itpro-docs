**Applies to**

[This information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.]

## Introduction
The Diagnostic Data Viewer is a Windows app that lets you review the diagnostic data your device is sending to Microsoft, grouping the info into simple categories based on how it's used by Microsoft.

## Install and Use the Diagnostic Data Viewer
You must turn on data viewing and download the app before you can use the Diagnostic Data Viewer to review your device's diagnostic data.

### Turn on data viewing
Before you can use this tool, you must turn on data viewing in the **Settings** panel. Turning on data viewing lets Windows store your device's diagnostic data until you turn it off. Turning off data viewing stops Windows from collecting your diagnostic data and clears the existing diagnostic data from your device.

**To turn on data viewing**
1. Go to **Start**, select **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Feedback & diagnostics**.

2. Under **Diagnostic data**, turn on the **If data viewing is enabled, you can see your diagnostics data** option.

    >[!Important]
    >Turning on data viewing can use up to 1GB of disk space on your system drive. We strongly recommend that your turn off data viewing when you're done using the Diagnostic Data Viewer. For info about turning off data viewing, see the [Turn off data viewing](#turn-off-data-viewing) section in this article.

### Use the Diagnostic Data Viewer
The Diagnostic Data Viewer provides you with the following features to view and filter your device's diagnostic data.

- **View your diagnostic events.** In the left column, you can review your diagnostic events. These events reflect activities that occurred and were sent to Microsoft. 

    Selecting an event opens the detailed JSON view, which provides the exact details uploaded to Microsoft. Microsoft uses this info to continually improve the Windows operating system.

- **Search your diagnostic events.** The **Search** box at the top of the screen lets you search amongst all of the diagnostic event details. The returned search results include any diagnostic event that contains the matching text. 

    Selecting an event opens the detailed JSON view, with the matching text highlighted.

- **Filter your diagnostic event categories.** The apps Menu button opens the detailed menu. In here, you'll find a list of diagnostic event categories, which define how the events are used by Microsoft.

    Selecting a check box lets you filter between the diagnostic event categories.

- **Provide diagnostic event feedback.** The **Feedback** icon opens the Feedback Hub app, letting you provide feedback about the Diagnostic Data Viewer and the diagnostic events.

    Selecting a specific event in the Diagnostic Data Viewer automatically fills in the field in the Feedback Hub. You can add your comments to the box labeled, **Give us more detail (optional)**.
	
    >[!Important]
    >All content in the Feedback Hub is publicly viewable. Therefore, make sure you don't put any personal info into your feedback comments.

## Microsoft sampling processes
Microsoft collects your diagnostic data based on a sample population of Windows devices. This sampling data is shown in the Diagnostic Data Viewer in 2 ways:

- **Device-level sampling.** Windows devices are chosen by random number to be part of the group that sends additional data to Microsoft. If your device is part of this group, you'll see this icon (Fig. 1) in the Diagnostic Data Viewer.

- **Event-level sampling.** If your device is part of the random group sending additional data to Microsoft, you might see this icon (Fig. 2) next to specific events. This icon means that the event is part of the additional diagnostic data your device is sending to Microsoft. All of this data is used to help improve the Windows operating system.

## View additional diagnostic data in the Problem Reports tool
You can review additional Windows Error Reporting diagnostic data in the **View problem reports** tool. This tool provides you with a summary of various crash reports that are sent to Microsoft as part of Windows Error Reporting. We use this data to find and fix specific issues that are hard to replicate and to improve the Windows operating system.

**To view your Windows Error Reporting diagnostic data**
1. Go to **Start**, select **Control Panel** > **All Control Panel Items** > **Security and Maintenance** > **Problem Reports**.

## Use the Diagnostic Data Viewer
The Diagnostic Data Viewer provides you with the following features to view and filter your device's diagnostic data.

- **View your diagnostic events.** In the left column, you can review your diagnostic events. These events reflect activities that occurred and were sent to Microsoft. 

    Selecting an event opens the detailed JSON view, which provides the exact details uploaded to Microsoft. Microsoft uses this info to continually improve the Windows platform.

- **Search your diagnostic events.** The **Search** box at the top of the screen lets you search amongst all of the diagnostic event details. The returned search results include any diagnostic event that contains the matching text. 

    Selecting an event opens the detailed JSON view, with the matching text highlighted.

- **Filter your diagnostic event categories.** The 3-line **Menu** icon opens the detailed menu. In here, you'll find a list of diagnostic event categories, which define how the events are used by Microsoft.

    Selecting a check box lets you filter between the diagnostic event categories.

- **Provide diagnostic event feedback.** The **Feedback** icon opens the Feedback Hub app, letting you provide feedback about the Diagnostic Data Viewer and the diagnostic events.

    >[!Important]
    >All content in the Feedback Hub is publicly viewable. Therefore, make sure you don't put any personal info into your feedback comments.

    Selecting a specific event in the Diagnostic Data Viewer automatically fills in the field in the Feedback Hub. You can add your comments to the box labeled, **Give us more detail (optional)**.
	
## Microsoft sampling processes
Microsoft collects your diagnostic data based on a sample population of Windows devices. This sampling data is shown in the Diagnostic Data Viewer in 2 ways:

- **Device-level sampling.** Windows devices are chosen by random number to be part of the group that sends additional data to Microsoft. If your device is part of this group, you'll see this icon (Fig. 1) in the Diagnostic Data Viewer:

- **Event-level sampling.** If your device is part of the random group sending additional data to Microsoft, you will see this icon (Fig. 2) next to every specific event being sent to Microsoft. All of this data is used to help improve the Windows platform.

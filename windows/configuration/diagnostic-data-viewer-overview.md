    By turning on data viewing, Windows can temporarily keep a copy of your diagnostic data after it's sent to Microsoft.  <!--We need to clarify what we mean by temporarily. Is this only until they turn data viewing off? Does the file get deleted at that point? People aren't going to like how vague this is.-->

the check-boxes to filter between the categories.

## Windows Sampling
Microsoft collects Diagnostic Data from a sample population of Windows devices. This sampling behavior is seen in the application in 2 ways:
1. Device level sampling
2. Event level sampling

### Device level sampling
If windows device has a chance to be part of group which sends additional diagnostic data to Microsoft. Devices are chosen using a random number. If your device is part of this group, you will see the icon 
below in the 3-line menu in the Diagnostic Data Viewer.

### Event level sampling
If you're device is part of this group sending additional diagnostic data, you will see the icon below next to each event that is up-sampled. This icon indicates that the event is sent to Microsoft
as part of the additional diagnostic data to help improve the Windows platform.

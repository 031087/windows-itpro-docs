Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP) is an out-of-the-box Windows enterprise security service that enables enterprise cybersecurity teams to detect and respond to advanced threats on their networks. The service is composed of four main features:

-   **Advanced attack detection**: Actionable alerts with real-time
    visibility into cybersecurity threat incident details

-   **File deep analysis**: Dynamic cloud analysis to provide visibility
    into a fileâ€™s underlying behaviors

-   **Footprint service**: Proactive exploration of potential attacks, and
    the ability to map them to specific machines

-   **Threat intelligence**: Insights that are validated and enriched by
    security experts using telemetry gathered from resources worldwide

The following diagram shows these Windows Defender ATP service
components:

Investigating these alerts provides additional information and insight
into known attackers, their goals, and actionable recommendations.

Endpoint investigation capabilities in this service let you drill down
into security alerts and understand the scope and nature of a potential
breach. You can submit files for deep analysis and receive the results
without leaving the [Windows Defender ATP portal](https://seville.windows.com).

Windows Defender ATP works with existing Windows security technologies
on endpoints, such as Windows Defender, AppLocker, and Device Guard. It
can also work side-by-side with third-party security solutions and
antimalware products.

Windows Defender ATP leverages Microsoft technology and expertise to
detect sophisticated cyber-attacks, providing:

-   **Endpoint behavioral sensors**: Embedded in Windows 10, these sensors
    collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system
    (for example, process, registry, file, and network communications)
    and sends this telemetry to your Azure Active Directory (AAD)
    subscription.

-   **Cloud security analytics**: Leveraging big-data, machine-learning, and
    unique Microsoft optics across the Windows ecosystem (such as the
    [Microsoft Malicious Software Removal Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/malicious-software-removal-tool-details.aspx),
    enterprise cloud products (such as Office 365), and online assets
    (such as Bing and SmartScreen URL reputation), behavioral signals
    are translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses
    to advanced threats.

-   **Threat intelligence**: Generated by Microsoft hunters, security teams,
    and augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners, threat
    intelligence enables Windows Defender ATP to identify attacker
    tools, techniques, and procedures, and generate alerts when these
    are observed in collected telemetry.

# Recommended settings using Windows Defender SmartScreen in your organization

**Applies to:**
- WindowsÂ 10, Version 1703
- Windows 10 Mobile

By default, Windows Defender SmartScreen lets employees bypass warnings. Unfortunately, this can let employees continue to an unsafe site or to continue to download an unsafe file, even after being warned. Because of this possibility, we strongly recommend that you set up Windows Defender SmartScreen to block high-risk interactions instead of providing just a warning.

To better help you protect your organization, we recommend using these Windows Defender SmartScreen Group Policy and mobile device management (MDM) settings.

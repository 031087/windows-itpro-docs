When you enable endpoint protection for your clients, it will install an additional management layer on Windows Defender to manage the in-box Windows Defender agent. While the client user interface will still appear as Windows Defender, the management layer for Endpoint Protection will be listed in the **Add/Remove Programs** control panel, though it will appear as if the full product is installed.

# Manage updates for endpoints that are out of date

**Applies to**
-   WindowsÂ 10

**Audience**

- Network administrators

**Manageability available with**

- Group Policy
- System Center Configuration Manager
- PowerShell cmdlets
- Windows Management Instruction (WMI)



Windows Defender AV lets you define how long an endpoint can avoid an update before it is required to update and scan itself. This is especially useful in environments where devices are not often connected to a corporate or external network, or devices that are not used on a daily basis.

You can manage the following options with Group Policy, System Center Configuration Manager, Powershell cmdlets, and WMI classes:

- Define the number of days before an endpoint has outdated protection (PS WMI)
- Define the number of days after which a catch-up update must occur (PS WMI)

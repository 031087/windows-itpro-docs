# Audit Other Account Logon Events
**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
This topic for the IT professional describes the advanced security audit policy setting, **Audit Other Account Logon Events**, which allows you to audit events generated by responses to credential requests submitted for a user account logon that are not credential validation or Kerberos tickets.
Examples can include the following:
-   Remote Desktop session disconnections
-   New Remote Desktop sessions
-   Locking and unlocking a workstation
-   Invoking a screen saver
-   Dismissing a screen saver
-   Detection of a Kerberos replay attack, in which a Kerberos request with identical information was received twice
    **Note**  
    This condition could be caused by a network misconfiguration.
     
-   Access to a wireless network granted to a user or computer account
-   Access to a wired 802.1x network granted to a user or computer account
Event volume: Varies, depending on system use
Default: Not configured

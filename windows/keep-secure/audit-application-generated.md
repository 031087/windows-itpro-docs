# Audit Application Generated
**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
This topic for the IT professional describes the Advanced Security Audit policy setting, **Audit Application Generated**, which determines whether the operating system generates audit events when applications attempt to use the Windows Auditing application programming interfaces (APIs).
The following events can generate audit activity:
-   Creation, deletion, or initialization of an application client context
-   Application operations
Applications that are designed to use the Windows Auditing APIs can use this subcategory to log auditing events that are related to those APIs. The level, volume, relevance, and importance of these audit events depend on the application that generates them. The operating system logs the events as they are generated by the application.
Event volume: Depends on the installed app's use of the Windows Auditing APIs
Default: Not configured

# Minimum requirements for Windows Defender ATP

**Applies to**

- Windows 10 Insider Preview

<span style="color:#ED1C24;">[Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.]</span>

There are some minimum requirements for onboarding your network and endpoints.

## Minimum requirements

### Network and data storage and configuration requirements
Your organization must use Azure Active Directory (AAD) to manage users. AAD is used during
service onboarding to manage user-based access to the [Windows Defender ATP portal](https://seville.windows.com/).

If youâ€™d like help with using AAD to set up user access, contact the
[Windows Defender ATP Yammer group](https://www.yammer.com/wsscengineering/#/threads/inGroup?type=in_group&feedId=6869350&view=all) 
https://www.yammer.com/wsscengineering/\#/threads/inGroup?type=in\_group&feedId=7108776&view=all
or email [winatp@microsoft.com](mailto:winatp@microsoft.com).

When you run the onboarding wizard for the first time, you must choose
where your Windows Defender ATP-related information is stored: in either
a European or United States datacenter.

> **Notes**&nbsp;&nbsp;
-   You cannot change your data storage location after the
    first-time setup.
-   Review the [Windows Defender ATP data storage and privacy](data-storage-privacy-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md) for more information on where and how
    Microsoft stores your data.

### Endpoint hardware and software requirements
Endpoints on your network must run the Testing and Adoption Program
version of Windows 10 (Windows 10 TAP). The hardware requirements for
Windows Defender ATP on endpoints is the same as those for Windows 10
TAP.

> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp; Endpoints that are running Windows
Server and mobile versions of Windows are not supported.

Internet connectivity on endpoints is also required. See the
[Troubleshoot Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection onboarding issues](troubleshoot-onboarding-windows-advanced-threat-protection.md)
section for additional proxy configuration settings.

Before you configure endpoints, the telemetry and diagnostics service must be enabled. The service is enabled by default in Windows 10 TAP, but if it has been
disabled you can turn it on by following the instructions in the
[Troubleshoot Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection onboarding issues](troubleshoot-onboarding-windows-advanced-threat-protection.md) section.

### Deployment channel operating system requirements

You can choose to onboard endpoints with a scheduled Group Policy
(GP) update (using a GP package that you
download from the portal or during the service onboarding wizard) or
manual registry changes.

The following describes the minimum operating system or software version
required for each deployment channel.

Deployment channel | Minimum server requirements 
:---|:---
Group Policy settings | Windows Server 2008 R2
Manual registry modifications | No minimum requirements

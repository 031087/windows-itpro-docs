<td align="left"><p>To help protect your company from attacks which may originate from untrusted or attacker controlled font files, we’ve created the Blocking Untrusted Fonts feature. Using this feature, you can turn on a global setting that stops your employees from loading untrusted fonts processed using the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) onto your network. Untrusted fonts are any font installed outside of the %windir%/Fonts directory. Blocking untrusted fonts helps prevent both remote (web-based or email-based) and local EOP attacks that can happen during the font file-parsing process.</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>[Device Guard certification and compliance](device-guard-certification-and-compliance.md)</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Device Guard is a combination of hardware and software security features that, when configured together, will lock a device down so that it can only run trusted applications. If the app isn’t trusted it can’t run, period. It also means that even if an attacker manages to get control of the Windows kernel, he or she will be much less likely to be able to run malicious executable code after the computer restarts because of how decisions are made about what can run and when.</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>[Manage identity verification using Microsoft Passport](manage-identity-verification-using-microsoft-passport.md)</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>In Windows 10, Microsoft Passport replaces passwords with strong two-factor authentication on PCs and mobile devices. This authentication consists of a new type of user credential that is tied to a device and a Windows Hello (biometric) or PIN.</p></td>

<td align="left"><p>[Windows Hello biometrics in the enterprise](windows-hello-biometrics-in-the-enterprise.md)</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Windows Hello is the biometric authentication feature that helps strengthen authentication and helps to guard against potential spoofing through fingerprint matching and facial recognition.</p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>[Configure S/MIME for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile](configure-s-mime.md)</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>In Windows 10, S/MIME lets users encrypt outgoing messages and attachments so that only intended recipients who have a digital identification (ID), also known as a certificate, can read them. Users can digitally sign a message, which provides the recipients with a way to verify the identity of the sender and that the message hasn't been tampered with.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><p>[Install digital certificates on Windows 10 Mobile](installing-digital-certificates-on-windows-10-mobile.md)</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Digital certificates bind the identity of a user or computer to a pair of keys that can be used to encrypt and sign digital information. Certificates are issued by a certification authority (CA) that vouches for the identity of the certificate holder, and they enable secure client communications with websites and services.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><p>[Protect derived domain credentials with Credential Guard](credential-guard.md)</p></td>
<td align="left"><p>Introduced in Windows 10 Enterprise, Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security to isolate secrets so that only privileged system software can access them. Unauthorized access to these secrets can lead to credential theft attacks, such as Pass-the-Hash or Pass-The-Ticket. Credential Guard prevents these attacks by protecting NTLM password hashes and Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets.</p></td>

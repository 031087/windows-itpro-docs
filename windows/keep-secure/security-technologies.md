# Security technologies

As an IT professional, you can use these topics to learn more about the different security technologies that are available in Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile.

| Section | Description |
|-|-|
| [Access control](access-control.md) | Describes access control in Windows, which is the process of authorizing users, groups, and computers to access objects on the network or computer. Key concepts that make up access control are permissions, ownership of objects, inheritance of permissions, user rights, and object auditing. |
| [AppLocker](applocker-overview.md)| Describes AppLocker, and can help you decide if your organization can benefit from deploying AppLocker application control policies. AppLocker helps you control which apps and files users can run. These include executable files, scripts, Windows Installer files, dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), packaged apps, and packaged app installers.|
| [BitLocker](bitlocker-overview.md)| Provides information about BitLocker, which is a data protection feature that integrates with the operating system and addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers. |
| [Encrypted Hard Drive](encrypted-hard-drive.md) | Provides information about Encrypted Hard Drive, which uses the rapid encryption that is provided by BitLocker Drive Encryption to enhance data security and management.|
| [Security auditing](security-auditing-overview.md)| Describes how the IT professional can use the security auditing features in Windows, and how organizations can benefit from using these technologies, to enhance the security and manageability of networks.|
| [Security policy settings](security-policy-settings.md)| Provides a collection of reference topics that describe the common scenarios, architecture, and processes for security settings.|
| [Smart Cards](smart-card-windows-smart-card-technical-reference.md) | Provides a collection of references topics about smart cards, which are tamper-resistant portable storage devices that can enhance the security of tasks such as authenticating clients, signing code, securing e-mail, and signing in with a Windows domain account. |
| [Trusted Platform Module](trusted-platform-module-top-node.md)| Provides links to information about the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is a secure crypto-processor that helps you with actions such as generating, storing, and limiting the use of cryptographic keys. |
| [User Account Control](user-account-control-overview.md)| Provides information about User Account Control (UAC), which helps prevent malware from damaging a PC and helps organizations deploy a better-managed desktop. UAC can help block the automatic installation of unauthorized apps and prevent inadvertent changes to system settings.|
| [Virtual Smart Cards](virtual-smart-card-overview.md) | Provides information about deploying and managing virtual smart cards, which are functionally similar to physical smart cards and appear in Windows as smart cards that are always-inserted. Virtual smart cards use the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip that is available on computers in many organizations, rather than requiring the use of a separate physical smart card and reader. |
| [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection](windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md)| Provides information about Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP), an out-of-the-box Windows enterprise security service that enables enterprise cybersecurity teams to detect and respond to advanced threats on their networks.|
| [Windows Defender in Windows 10](windows-defender-in-windows-10.md)| Provides information about Windows Defender, a built-in antimalware solution that helps provide security and antimalware management for desktops, portable computers, and servers. Includes a list of system requirements and new features.|
| [Windows Firewall with Advanced Security](windows-firewall-with-advanced-security.md) | Provides information about Windows Firewall with Advanced Security, which is an important part of a layered security model.

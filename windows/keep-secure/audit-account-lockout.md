# Audit Account Lockout

**Applies to**
-   Windows 10
-   Windows 10 Mobile

This topic for the IT professional describes the advanced security audit policy setting, **Audit Account Lockout**, which enables you to audit security events that are generated by a failed attempt to log on to an account that is locked out.

If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated when an account cannot log on to a computer because the account is locked out. Success audits record successful attempts and failure audits record unsuccessful attempts.

Account lockout events are essential for understanding user activity and detecting potential attacks.

Event volume: Low

Default setting: Success

| Event ID | Event message |
| - | - |
| 4625 | An account failed to log on. |

# Troubleshoot Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection onboarding issues

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10, version 1607.
- Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)

You might need to troubleshoot the Windows Defender ATP onboarding process if you encounter issues.
This page provides detailed steps for troubleshooting endpoints that aren't reporting correctly, and common error codes encountered during onboarding.

If you have completed the endpoint onboarding process and don't see endpoints in the [Machines view](investigate-machines-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md) after an hour, it might indicate an endpoint onboarding or connectivity problem.

Go through the following verification topics to address this issue:

- [Ensure the endpoint is onboarded successfully](#Ensure-that-the-endpoint-is-onboarded-successfully)
- [Ensure the Windows Defender ATP service is enabled](#Ensure-that-the-Windows-Defender-ATP-service-is-enabled)
- [Ensure the telemetry and diagnostics service is enabled](#Ensure-that-telemetry-and-diagnostics-service-is-enabled)
- [Ensure the endpoint has an Internet connection](#Ensure-that-the-Windows-Defender-ATP-endpoint-has-internet-connection)


## Ensure the endpoint is onboarded successfully
If the endpoints aren't reporting correctly, you might need to check that the Windows Defender ATP service was successfully onboarded onto the endpoint.

**Check the onboarding state in Registry**:

1. Click **Start**, type **Run**, and press **Enter**.

2. From the **Run** dialog box, type **regedit** and press **Enter**.

3. In the **Registry Editor** navigate to the Status key under:

   ```text
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat Protection
```

4. Check the **OnboardingState** value is set to **1**.

  ![Image of OnboardingState status in Registry Editor](images/onboardingstate.png)

If the **OnboardingState** value is not set to **1**, you can use Event Viewer to review errors on the endpoint.

**Use Event Viewer to identify and address onboarding errors**:   

1. Click **Start**, type **Event Viewer**, and press **Enter**.

2. In the **Event Viewer (Local)** pane, expand **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > **SENSE**.

  > [!NOTE]
	> SENSE is the internal name used to refer to the behavioral sensor that powers Windows Defender ATP.

3. Select **Operational** to load the log.

4. In the **Action** pane, click **Filter Current log**.

5. On the **Filter** tab, under **Event level:** select **Critical**, **Warning**, and **Error**, and click **OK**.

  ![Image of Event Viewer log filter](images/filter-log.png)

6. Events which can indicate issues will appear in the **Operational** pane. You can attempt to troubleshoot them based on the solutions in the following table:

Event ID | Message | Resolution steps
:---|:---|:---
5 | Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection service failed to connect to the server at _variable_ | [Ensure the endpoint has Internet access](#ensure-the-endpoint-has-an-internet-connection).
6 | Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection service is not onboarded and no onboarding parameters were found. Failure code: _variable_ | [Run the onboarding script again](configure-endpoints-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md#manual).
7 |  Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection service failed to read the onboarding parameters. Failure code: _variable_ | [Ensure the endpoint has Internet access](#ensure-the-endpoint-has-an-internet-connection), then run the entire onboarding process again.
15 | Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection cannot start command channel with URL: _variable_ | [Ensure the endpoint has Internet access](#ensure-the-endpoint-has-an-internet-connection).
25 | Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection service failed to reset health status in the registry. Failure code: _variable_ | Contact support.

## Ensure the Windows Defender ELAM driver is enabled
If your endpoints are running a third-party antimalware client, the Windows Defender ATP agent needs the Windows Defender Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM) driver to be enabled.

**Check the ELAM driver status:**
1.	Open a command-line prompt on the endpoint:

  a. Click **Start**, type **cmd**, and select **Command prompt**.

2.	Enter the following command, and press Enter:
```
sc qc WdBoot
```
If the ELAM driver is enabled, the output will be:

```
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: WdBoot
        TYPE               : 1  KERNEL_DRIVER
        START_TYPE         : 0   BOOT_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : \SystemRoot\system32\drivers\WdBoot.sys
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   : Early-Launch
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : Windows Defender Boot Driver
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME :
```
If the ELAM driver is disabled the output will be:
```
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: WdBoot
        TYPE               : 1  KERNEL_DRIVER
        START_TYPE         : 0   DEMAND_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : \SystemRoot\system32\drivers\WdBoot.sys
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   : _Early-Launch
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : Windows Defender Boot Driver
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME :
```
### Enable the ELAM driver

1. Open an elevated PowerShell console on the endpoint:

  a. Click **Start**, type **powershell**.

  b. Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.

2. Run the following PowerShell cmdlet:
```
'Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypassâ€™
```
3. Run the following PowerShell script:

```
Add-Type @'
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using Microsoft.Win32.SafeHandles;
using System.ComponentModel;

public static class Elam{
    [DllImport("Kernel32", CharSet=CharSet.Auto, SetLastError=true)]
    public static extern bool InstallELAMCertificateInfo(SafeFileHandle handle);

    public static void InstallWdBoot(string path)
    {
        Console.Out.WriteLine("About to call create file on {0}", path);
        var stream = File.Open(path, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read);
        var handle = stream.SafeFileHandle;

        Console.Out.WriteLine("About to call InstallELAMCertificateInfo on handle {0}", handle.DangerousGetHandle());
        if (!InstallELAMCertificateInfo(handle))
        {
            Console.Out.WriteLine("Call failed.");
            throw new Win32Exception(Marshal.GetLastWin32Error());
        }
        Console.Out.WriteLine("Call successful.");
    }
}
'@

$driverPath = $env:SystemRoot + "\System32\Drivers\WdBoot.sys"
[Elam]::InstallWdBoot($driverPath)
```
### Ensure the Windows Defender ATP service is enabled
If the endpoints aren't reporting correctly, you might need to check that the Windows Defender ATP service is set to automatically start and is running on the endpoint.

You can use the SC command line program for checking and managing the startup type and running state of the service.

**Check the Windows Defender ATP service startup type from the command line:**

1.  Open an elevated command-line prompt on the endpoint:

  a.  Click **Start**, type **cmd**, and press **Enter**.

  b.  Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.

2.  Enter the following command, and press **Enter**:

    ```text
    sc qc sense
    ```

If the the service is running, then the result should look like the following screenshot:

  ![Result of the sq query sense command](images/sc-query-sense-autostart.png)

If the service `START_TYPE` is not set to `AUTO_START`, then you'll need to set the service to automatically start.

**Change the Windows Defender ATP service startup type from the command line:**

1.  Open an elevated command-line prompt on the endpoint:

  a.  Click **Start**, type **cmd**, and press **Enter**.

  b.  Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.

2.  Enter the following command, and press **Enter**:

    ```text
    sc config sense start=auto
    ```

3.  A success message is displayed. Verify the change by entering the following command and press **Enter**:

    ```text
    sc qc sense
    ```

**Check the Windows Defender ATP service is running from the command line:**

1.  Open an elevated command-line prompt on the endpoint:

  a.  Click **Start**, type **cmd**, and press **Enter**.

  b.  Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.

2.  Enter the following command, and press **Enter**:

    ```text
    sc query sense
    ```

If the service is running, the result should look like the following screenshot:

![Result of the sc query sense command](images/sc-query-sense-running.png)

If the service **STATE** is not set to **RUNNING**, then you'll need to start it.

**Start the Windows Defender ATP service from the command line:**

1.  Open an elevated command-line prompt on the endpoint:

  a.  Click **Start**, type **cmd**, and press **Enter**.

  b.  Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.

    sc start sense
    ```

3.  A success message is displayed. Verify the change by entering the following command and press **Enter**:

    ```text
    sc qc sense
    ```

### Ensure the telemetry and diagnostics service is enabled
If the endpoints aren't reporting correctly, you might need to check that the Windows 10 telemetry and diagnostics service is set to automatically start and is running on the endpoint. The service may have been disabled by other programs or user configuration changes.

First, you should check that the service is set to start automatically when Windows starts, then you should check that the service is currently running (and start it if it isn't).

### Ensure the service is set to start

**Use the command line to check the Windows 10 telemetry and diagnostics service startup type**:

1.  Open an elevated command-line prompt on the endpoint:

  a.  Click **Start**, type **cmd**, and press **Enter**.

  b.  Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.

2.  Enter the following command, and press **Enter**:

    ```text
    sc qc diagtrack
    ```

If the service is enabled, then the result should look like the following screenshot:

![Result of the sc query command for diagtrack](images/windefatp-sc-qc-diagtrack.png)

If the `START_TYPE` is not set to `AUTO_START`, then you'll need to set the service to automatically start.


**Use the command line to set the Windows 10 telemetry and diagnostics service to automatically start:**

1.  Open an elevated command-line prompt on the endpoint:

  a.  Click **Start**, type **cmd**, and press **Enter**.

  b.  Right-click **Command prompt** and select **Run as administrator**.

2.  Enter the following command, and press **Enter**:

    ```text
    sc config diagtrack start=auto
    ```

1.  Open the services console:

  a. Click **Start** and type **services**.

  b. Press **Enter** to open the console.

2.  Scroll through the list of services until you find **Connected User Experiences and Telemetry**.

3.  Check the **Startup type** column - the service should be set as **Automatic**.

If the startup type is not set to **Automatic**, you'll need to change it so the service starts when the endpoint does.


**Use the Windows Services console to set the Windows 10 telemetry and diagnostics service to automatically start:**

1.  Open the services console:

  a. Click **Start** and type **services**.

  b. Press **Enter** to open the console.

![Select Start to start the service](images/windef-utc-console-start.png)


### Ensure the endpoint has an Internet connection

The Window Defender ATP sensor requires Microsoft Windows HTTP (WinHTTP) to report telemetry and communicate with the Windows Defender ATP service.

WinHTTP is independent of the Internet browsing proxy settings and other user context applications and must be able to detect the proxy servers that are available in your particular environment.

To ensure that sensor has service connectivity, follow the steps described in the [Verify client connectivity to Windows Defender ATP service URLs](configure-proxy-internet-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md#verify-client-connectivity-to-windows-defender-atp-service-urls) topic.

If the verification fails and your environment is using a proxy to connect to the Internet, then follow the steps described in [Configure proxy and Internet connectivity settings](configure-proxy-internet-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md) topic.  

## Troubleshoot onboarding issues using the script
If you configured your endpoints with a deployment tool that required a script, you can check the event viewer for the onboarding script results.

**Check the result of the script**:
1. Click **Start**, type **Event Viewer**, and press **Enter**.

2. Go to **Windows Logs** > **Application**.

3. Look for an event from **WDATPOnboarding** event source.

If the script fails and the event is an error, you can check the event ID in the following table to help you troubleshoot the issue.
> [!NOTE]
> The following event IDs are specific to the onboarding script only.

Event ID | Error Type | Resolution steps
:---|:---|:---
5 | Offboarding data was found but couldn't be deleted | Check the permissions on the registry, specifically ```HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat Protection```
10 | Onboarding data couldn't be written to registry |  Check the permissions on the registry, specifically ```HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat```. Verify that the script was ran as an administrator.
15 |  Failed to start SENSE service |Check the service status (```sc query sense``` command). Make sure it's not in an intermediate state (*'Pending_Stopped'*, *'Pending_Running'*) and try to run the script again (with administrator rights).
15 | Failed to start SENSE service | If the message of the error is: System error 577 has occurred. You need to enable the Windows Defender ELAM driver, see [Ensure the Windows Defender ELAM driver is enabled](#ensure-the-windows-defender-elam-driver-is-enabled) for instructions.
30 |  The script failed to wait for the service to start running | The service could have taken more time to start or has encountered errors while trying to start. For more information on events and errors related to SENSE, see [Review events and errors on endpoints with Event viewer](event-error-codes-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md)
35 |  The script failed to find needed onboarding status registry value | When the SENSE service starts for the first time, it writes onboarding status to the registry location ```HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat Protection\Status```. The script failed to find it after several seconds. You can manually test it and check if it's there. For more information on events and errors related to SENSE, see [Review events and errors on endpoints with Event viewer](event-error-codes-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md)
40 | SENSE service onboarding status is not set to **1** | The SENSE service has failed to onboard properly. For more information on events and errors related to SENSE, see [Review events and errors on endpoints with Event viewer](event-error-codes-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md)
65 | Insufficient privileges| Run the script again with administrator privileges.

## Troubleshoot onboarding issues using Microsoft Intune
You can use Microsoft Intune to check error codes and attempt to troubleshoot the cause of the issue.

Use the following tables to understand the possible causes of issues while onboarding:

- Microsoft Intune error codes and OMA-URIs table
- Known issues with non-compliance table
- Mobile Device Management (MDM) event logs table

If none of the event logs and troubleshooting steps work, download the Local script from the **Endpoint Management** section of the portal, and run it in an elevated command prompt.  

**Microsoft Intune error codes and OMA-URIs**:

Error Code Hex | Error Code Dec | Error Description | OMA-URI | Possible cause and troubleshooting steps
:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
0x87D1FDE8 | -2016281112 | Remediation failed | Onboarding <br> Offboarding |  **Possible cause:** Onboarding or offboarding failed on a wrong blob: wrong signature or missing PreviousOrgIds fields. <br><br> **Troubleshooting steps:** <br> Check the event IDs in the [Ensure the endpoint is onboarded successfully](#ensure-the-endpoint-is-onboarded-successfully) section. <br><br> Check the MDM event logs in the following table or follow the instructions in [Diagnose MDM failures in Windows 10](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/mt632120%28v=vs.85%29.aspx).
 | | | Onboarding <br> Offboarding <br> SampleSharing | **Possible cause:** Windows Defender ATP Policy registry key does not exist or the OMA DM client doesn't have permissions to write to it. <br><br> **Troubleshooting steps:** Ensure that the following registry key exists: ```HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat Protection```. <br> <br> If it doesn't exist, open an elevated command and add the key.
  | | | SenseIsRunning <br> OnboardingState <br> OrgId |  **Possible cause:** An attempt to remediate by read-only property.

   | | | All | **Possible cause:** Attempt to deploy Windows Defender ATP on non-supported SKU/Platform, particularly Holographic SKU. <br><br> Currently is supported platforms:  Enterprise, Education, and Professional. <br> Server is not supported.
   0x87D101A9 | -2016345687 |Syncml(425): The requested command failed because the sender does not have adequate access control permissions (ACL) on the recipient.  | All |  **Possible cause:** Attempt to deploy Windows Defender ATP on non-supported SKU/Platform, particularly Holographic SKU. <br><br> Currently is supported platforms:  Enterprise, Education, and Professional.

<br>
**Known issues with non-compliance**

The following table provides information on issues with non-compliance and how you can address the issues.

Case | Symptoms | Possible cause and troubleshooting steps
:---|:---|:---
1 | Machine is compliant by SenseIsRunning OMA-URI. But is non-compliant by OrgId, Onboarding and OnboardingState OMA-URIs. | **Possible cause:** Check that user passed OOBE after Windows installation or upgrade. During OOBE onboarding couldn't be completed but SENSE is running already. <br><br> **Troubleshooting steps:** Wait for OOBE to complete.
2 |  Machine is compliant by OrgId, Onboarding, and OnboardingState OMA-URIs, but is non-compliant by SenseIsRunning OMA-URI. |  **Possible cause:** Sense service's startup type is set as "Delayed Start". Sometimes this causes the Microsoft Intune server to report the machine as non-compliant by SenseIsRunning when DM session occurs on system start. <br><br> **Troubleshooting steps:** The issue should automatically be fixed within 24 hours.
3 | Machine is non-compliant | **Troubleshooting steps:** Ensure that Onboarding and Offboarding policies are not deployed on the same machine at same time.

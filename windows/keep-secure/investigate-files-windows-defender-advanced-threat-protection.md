## Investigate a file
Investigate the details of a file associated with a specific alert, behavior, or event to help determine if the file exhibits malicious activities, identify the attack motivation, and understand the potential scope of the breach. 

You can get information from the following sections in the file view:

- File details
- Deep analysis
- File in organization
- Observed in organization

The file details section shows attributes of the file such as its MD5 hash or number and its prevalence worldwide.

The **Deep analysis** section provides the option of submitting a file for deep analysis to gain detailed visibility on observed suspicious behaviors, and associated artifacts. For more information on submitting files for deep analysis, see the **Deep analysis** topic.

The **File in organization** section provides details on the prevalence of the file and the name observed in the organization. 

The **Observed in organization** section provides a chronological view on the events and associated alerts that were observed on the file. 

You'll see a list of machines associated with the file and a description of the action taken by the file.

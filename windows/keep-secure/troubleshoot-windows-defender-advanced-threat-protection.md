This section addresses issues that might arise as you use the Windows Defender Advanced Threat service.

###Server error - Access is denied due to invalid credentials
If you encounter a server error when trying to access the service, youâ€™ll need to change your browser cookie settings.
Configure your browser to allow cookies.

### No data is shown on the portal
If no data is displayed on the Dashboard portal even if no errors were encountered in the portal logs or in the browser console, you'll need to whitelist TI and DA endpoints and detonation endpoints that also use the this protocol.

QUESTIONs TO NAMAA:

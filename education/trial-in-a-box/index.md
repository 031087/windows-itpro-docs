With Microsoft Education Trial in a Box:

* Students can be more creative, collaborative, and improve problem-solving skills with Minecraft: Education Edition and bring ideas to life in 3D
* IT admins can learn about the tools they can use to implement and deploy a full cloud infrastructure for their school that's secure and easy to manage

## What's in Trial in a Box?

* **User name and passwords** - We've already set up a cloud-based school using Microsoft 365 Education. Your login credentials are included in the kit.
* **Device A** - A 2-in-1 convertible PC that supports digital ink. This device is pre-configured with Windows 10 S<sup>[1](#footnote1),</sup> <sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup> and ready for login so you can try the Microsoft Education classroom experience. 
* **Device B** - An affordable PC designed to survive the rigors of classroom life. This PC has a fresh installation of Windows 10 S<sup>[1](#footnote1),</sup> <sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup> so you can see how easy it is to set up a brand new device.
* **Accessories** - A wireless mouse to use with Minecraft: Education Edition, a USB memory stick to set up school PCs, and a network adapter (just in case).

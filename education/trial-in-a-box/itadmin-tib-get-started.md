## Go through Intune for Education express configuration
Intune for Education provides an **Express configuration** option so you can get going right away. We'll use that option here.

2. On the Intune for Education dashboard, click **Launch Express Configuration** or select the **Express configuration**.

3. In the **Welcome to Intune for Education** screen, click **Get started** and follow the prompts until you get to the **Choose group** screen.
4. In the **Choose group** screen, select **All Users** so that all apps and settings that we select during express setup will apply to this group. 

  You can choose another group during this step, but note that your experience may vary from what we show in the guide.

5. In the **Choose apps** screen, you will see a selection of desktop (Win32) apps, Web apps, and Microsoft Store apps. 

    ![Choose apps you want to provision to the group](images/i4e_expressconfig_chooseapps.png)

6. Add or remove apps by clicking on them. A blue checkmark means the app is added and will be installed for all members of the group selected in the **Choose group** step.

    It's up to you to select the apps you choose to install. Just remember what they are so that later you can verify that the apps were installed correctly on the device.

    > [!TIP]
    > Web apps are pushed as links in the Windows Start menu under **All apps**. If you want apps to appear in Microsoft Edge browser tabs, use the **Homepages** setting for Microsoft Edge through **Express configuration** or **Manage Users and Devices**.

7. In the **Choose settings** screen, set the settings to apply to the group. Expand each settings group to see all the configurable settings.

    For example, set these settings:
    - In the **Basic device settings** group, change the **Block changing language settings** and **Block changing device region settings** to **Block**.
    - In the **Microsoft Edge settings** group, change the **Block pop-ups** setting to **Block**.

8. Click **Next** and review the list of apps and settings you selected to apply.
9. Click **Save** and then click **All done** to go back to the dashboard.

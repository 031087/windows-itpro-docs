## OneNote
**With OneNote**, students experience the power of inking and media-rich projects.  
 
**Try this!** Reimagine the Great Pyramids of Giza 
 
OneNote acts as an unlimited digital canvas for the whole class to store text, images, handwritten drawings, attachments, links, voice, video, and more. See how a group project comes together with opportunities to interact with other students, multimedia, and sophisticated drawing tools. This one works best with your digital pen! 

**Directions:**

1. Open the Windows **Start** menu ![Windows Start menu](images/windows_start.png) and select the OneNote for Windows 10 app. 
2. OneNote will automatically open to the **Reimagine the Great Pyramid of Giza** lesson page inside the 21st Century Learning notebook.

## Microsoft Forms
**With Forms**, teachers collect, share, and visualize data easily.  
 
**Try this!** Create a Response to Intervention Observation Tool to share with colleagues.  
 
Many educators have already experienced the power of using Microsoft Forms to create quizzes to assess student progress and get real-time feedback.  
Forms isn't just about quizzes, though — it's also a powerful tool for collecting and disseminating relevant information across a school community, from teachers and school staff to students and their families.  This kind of measurable support can lead to greater student success, especially when it's in a nimble solution that helps them quickly and securely track student data.   
See below for an example of a Response to Intervention a school might use to identify an area of support for a student, supports provided to that student, and what might be the next steps for a team supporting this student.  
 
[INSERT HIGH RES IMAGE of example RTI FORM] Schools can easily collect and share Response to Intervention Observation Forms across teachers and share relevant outcomes to a student’s family during important meetings.  
 
**Directions:**

1. From your Office 365 App Launcher, select **Forms**. Or in your web browser, navigate to <a href="https://forms.microsoft.com" target="_blank">https://forms.microsoft.com</a>.
2. Under **My Forms**, click **New Form** to begin creating your data collection tool.
3. Once your new form appears, replace *Untitled form* with a title that relates to your topic, such as *Response to Intervention Observation Tool*. You can also enter an optional description to offer important reminders to key stakeholders.  
4. Select the **Add question** button.  When prompted to make the question choice, select **Date**. In the text field, add a prompt such as: *Enter date of observation*
5. To ensure this prompt is completed by the observer, move the toggle in the question field to **Required**.
6. Select **Add question** button and select **Text**.  In the text field, add the prompt: *Enter the student’s first and last name*.  Because this answer to this question is essential data, ensure that you have selected **Required**.
7. Continue to add essential questions that may address time of day, period, teacher names, and more. 
8. Other important data points that some schools choose to observe: 
  - Peer-to-peer interactions 
  - Intellectual persistence 
  - Task completion 
  - Participation in school day activities 
  - Unstructured play  
  - Retention of concepts or skills 
9. To create a question which requires multiple answers, select **Add question**. Then select the multiple-choice option. Within the question field, move the toggle for multiple answers. 
10. When you have completed all questions, click **Preview** at the top of the design window to see how your form looks on a computer or mobile device. To test your form, enter answers for the questions in preview mode and then click **Submit**. 
11. Once complete, share the form with staff members responsible for observing and collecting data.   
12. There are four options for sending and collecting responses: 
  - Copy a link 
  - Send a QR code 
  - Embed the form to a web page

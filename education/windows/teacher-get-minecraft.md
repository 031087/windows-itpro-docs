## Distribute Minecraft

After Minecraft Education Edition is added to your Windows Store for Business, you have three options:

- You can install the app on your PC.
- You can assign the app to others.  Enter email addresses for your students, and each student will get an email with a link to install the app. This option is best for older, more-tech savvy students who always use the same PC at school.
- You can download the app to distribute. This downloads a provisioning package (.ppkg) file. You save the file on a USB drive, and install the app on PCs from the UBb drive. This option is best for younger students and for shared computers.

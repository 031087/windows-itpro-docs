Learn whatâ€™s new with the Set up School PCs app each week. Find out about new app features and functionality, and see updated screenshots. You'll also find information about past releases. 

## Week of October 15, 2018

The Set up School PCs app was updated with the following changes:

### Three new setup screens added to the app
The following screens and functionality were added to the setup workflow. Select any screenname to view the relevant steps and screenshots in the Set Up School PCs docs.  

[**Package name**](use-set-up-school-pcs-app.md#package-name): Customize a package name to make it easy to recognize it from your school's other packages. The name is generated by Azure Active Directory and appears as the filename and as the token name in Azure AD in the Azure portal.  

[**Product key**](use-set-up-school-pcs-app.md#product-key): Enter a product key to upgrade your current edition of Windows 10, or change
the existing product key. 

[**Personalization**](use-set-up-school-pcs-app.md#personalization): Upload images from your computer to customize how the lock screen and background appears on student devices.

### Azure AD token expiration extended to 180 days
Packages now expire 180 days from the date they are created. [An update has also been made](use-set-up-school-pcs-app.md#package-name) to append the date to the end of the package name. Example name: SetUpSchoolPCS (Expires 4-22-2019)  

### Updated apps with more helpful, descriptive text 
The app's **Skip** buttons were updated with new text to clarify the intent of each action. An **Exit** button was also added to the last page of the app.  

### Option to keep existing device names
If you want to keep the orginal names of your student devices, the [**Name these devices** screen](use-set-up-school-pcs-app.md#device-names) now lets you click **Continue with existing names.**  

### Skype and Messaging apps to be removed from student PCs by default
The Skype and Messaging app has been added to a selection of apps that are, by default, removed from student devices.

When you sign up for early access to [Minecraft Education Edition](http://education.minecraft.net), Minecraft will be added to the inventory in your Windows Store for Business, a private version of Windows Store associated with your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. Your Store for Business is only displayed to members of your organization.

> **Note**: If you don't have an Azure AD or Office 365 tenant, you can set up a free Office 365 subscription when you request Minecraft Education Edition.

## Add Minecraft to your Windows Store for Business 

1. Go to [http://education.minecraft.net/](http://education.minecraft.net/) and select **Get the app**.

3. Select **Get the app**. This will take you to the Windows Store for Business to download the app. You will also receive an email with instructions and a link to the Store.

## Distribute Minecraft

After Minecraft Education Edition is added to your Windows Store for Business, you have three options:

- You can install the app on your PC.
- You can assign the app to others.  Enter email addresses for your students, and each student will get an email with a link to install the app. This option is best for older, more-tech savvy students who always use the same PC at school.
- You can download the app to distribute. This downloads a provisioning package (.ppkg) file. You save the file on a USB drive, and install the app on PCs from the UBb drive. This option is best for younger students and for shared computers.

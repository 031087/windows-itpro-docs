- Your students share Windows 10 computers, but sign in with their own Windows account.

- Administrative permissions are required on the PC. If you don't have the correct permissions, you won't be able to install the app. 
- Windows 10 (at least version 1511) is required for PCs running Minecraft: Education Edition.

**Check for updates**</br>
Minecraft: Education Edition will not install if there are updates pending for other apps on the PC. Before installing Minecraft, check to see if there are pending updates for Windows Store apps. 

**To check for app updates**
1. Start Windows Store app on the PC (click **Start**, and type **Store**).
2. Click the account button, and then click **Downloads and updates**.

      ![Windows Store app showing access to My Library](images/minecraft-private-store.png)

**To download for others**</br>

1. **Download Minecraft Education Edition.zip**. From the **Minecraft: Education Edition** page, click **Download for others** tab, and then click **Download**.

    ![Windows Store app showing access to My Library](images/mc-dnld-others-admin.png)
 
2. **Extract files**. Find the .zip file that you downloaded and extract the files. This is usually your **Downloads** folder, unless you chose to save the .zip file to a different location. Right-click the file and choose **Extract all**.
3. **Save to USB drive**. After you've extracted the files, save the Minecraft: Education Edition folder to a USB drive, or to a network location that you can access from each PC.  
4. **Install app**. Use the USB drive to copy the Minecraft folder to each Windows 10 PC where you want to install Minecraft: Education Edition. Open Minecraft: Education Edition folder, right-click **InstallMinecraftEducationEdition.bat** and click **Run as administrator**. 
5. **Quick check**. The install program checks the PC to make sure it can run Minecraft: Education Edition. If your PC passes this test, the app will automatically install.
6. **Restart**. Once installation is complete, restart each PC. Minecraft: Education Edition app is now ready for any student to use.


## Manage Minecraft: Education Edition

### Access to Windows Store for Business
By default, when a teacher with a work or school account acquires Minecraft: Education Edition, they are automatically signed up for Window Store for Business, and the **Basic Purchaser** role is assigned to them. **Basic Purchaser** role allows teachers to acquire Minecraft: Education Edition and to distribute it to students. 

However, tenant admins can control whether or not teachers automatically sign up for Windows Store for Business, and get the **Basic Purchaser** role. You can configure this with the **Allow educators in my organization to sign up for the Windows Store for Business.** You'll find this on the **Permissions** page. 

To prevent educators from automatically signing up for Windows Store for Business
1.  In Windows Store for Business, click **Settings**, and then click **Permissions**.

2. Click **Allow educators in my organization to sign up for the Windows Store for Business.**

### Roles and permissions
Minecraft: Education Edition adds a new role for teachers: **Basic Purchaser**. When a teacher has been granted this role, they can:
- View the Minecraft product description page 
- Acquire and manage the app
- Info on Support page (including links to documentation and access to support through customer service)

## <a href="" id="private-store"></a>Private store

When you create you Windows Store for Business account, you'll have a set of apps included for free in your private store. Apps in your private store are available for all people in your organization to install and use. 

These apps will automatically be in your private store:
- Word mobile
- Excel mobile
- PowerPoint mobile
- OneNote
- Sway
- Fresh Paint
- Minecraft: Education Edition

As an admin, you can remove any of these apps from the private store if you'd prefer to control how apps are distributed.  

<!-- ## Need more copies of Minecraft: Education Edition?
You can purchase more licenses by working with your channel partner. Licenses are available at a lower rate than the price for individual copies that are available through Windows Store for Business. Individual copies are also available through Windows Store for Business. 

If you’ve purchased a volume license, be sure to let other basic purchasers in your organization know about the volume license. That should help prevent unnecessary purchases of individual copies. -->

This diagram shows a high-level view of what we cover in this walkthrough. The numbers correspond to the sections in the walkthrough and roughly correspond to the flow of the overall process, but note that not all sections are shown in the diagram.

![Deploy and manage a full cloud IT solution using MSES](images/mses_getstarted_workflow_e2e.png)

## Prerequisites
Here's a few a tasks you need to complete before you start the walkthrough:
- [Download and install the latest Windows 10 Creators Update image](#download-and-install-the-latest-windows-10-creators-update-image). 

  This process takes a while so we recommend that you start this task before setting up your cloud infrastructure.

- Open an InPrivate session on your browser.

## 1. Set up your cloud infrastructure
In the following sections, we'll walk you through the process of setting up a basic cloud infrastructure for your school.

### 1.1 Set up your Office 365 Education tenant
Schools can use Office 365 to save time and be more productive. Built with powerful tools and accessible from any device, setting it up is the first step in getting your school to the cloud. 

**To set up Office 365**
1. Create an account and a user ID and password to use to sign into your account. 

  **Figure 1** - Office 365 account creation

  ![Create an Office 365 account](images/o365_createaccount.png)

2. Save your sign-in info so you can use it to sign into https://portal.office.com (the sign-in page). Click **You're ready to go...** 
3. In the **Verify eligibility for Microsoft Office 365 Education** screen:
  1. In the **welcome** screen, click **Next**.
  2. In the **type a domain name** screen, click **I'll verify later** and then click **Yes** on the confirmation window that pops up. 
4. Once the confirmation window goes away, you should see the Office 365 admin center.

   **Figure 2** - Office 365 admin center

   ![Office 365 admin center](images/o365_admincenter_welcome.png)

5. **Optional**. On the **Welcome to the new Office 365 admin center** pop-up window, click **Next** to get a brief tour of the admin center.

As part of setting up a basic cloud infrastructure, you don't need to complete the rest of the Office 365 Education setup so we will skip the rest of setup for now and start importing school data. You can pick up where you left off with Office 365 Education setup once you've completed the rest of the steps in the walkthrough. See [4.2 Complete Office 365 Education setup](#42-complete-office-365-education-setup) for info.

### 1.2 Turn on Classroom and use SDS to import SIS data
Teachers and students can use Microsoft Classroom to manage all classses and assignment workflows. Teachers can use it to create a class notebook for everyone in the class, use it to create assignments for multiple classes at the same time, and more. See the <a href="https://classroom.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Classroom</a> site to learn more. 

School Data Sync (SDS) helps you import Student Information System (SIS) data into Office 365. It helps automate the process for importing and integrating SIS data that you can use with Office 365 and apps like Classroom and OneNote Class Notebooks. To learn more about School Data Sync (SDS) and the deployment methods available to you, see <a href="https://aka.ms/sdsoverview" target="_blank">Overview of School Data Sync and Classroom</a>. We recommend using comma separated value (CSV) files with SDS to synchronize SIS users with Office 365. However, SDS supports many other deployment options such as PowerSchool Sync, Clever Sync, and OneRoster CSV files. See the *For IT admins* section in [Get more info](#get-more-info) to learn more about these other deployment options.

In this section of the walkthrough, we created a new education tenant and we need to add new users. To simplify this process, we will use sample SDS files to prepopulate our tenant with school data. We also need to turn on Microsoft Classroom to enable users to access the app.

**<a name="downloadcsvsamples"></a>Download sample school data**

1. Go to the <a href="https://aka.ms/sdsscripts" target="_blank">O365-EDU-Tools GitHub site</a>.
2. Click the green **Clone or download** button to download the SDS sample files.

  **Figure 3** - Download the SDS sample files from GitHub

  ![Download the SDS sample files from GitHub](images/sds_github_downloadsampledata.png)

3. In the **Clone with HTTPS** pop-up window, choose **Download ZIP** and note the location where you're saving the folder.
4. Go to the folder where you saved the .zip and unzip the files.
5. Open the **O365-EDU-Tools-master** folder and then open the **CSV Samples** subfolder. Confirm that you can see the following sample CSV files.

  **Figure 4** - Sample CSV files

  ![Use the sample CSV files](images/sds_sample_csvfiles.png)

  > [!NOTE] 
  > - The sample CSV files uses sample accounts and passwords. If you are using the sample files for testing, remember the accounts and their corresponding passwords. You may be asked to change the password during your first sign in. 
  > - If you are modifying the sample CSV files to use in your organization, change the accounts and passwords to match the user accounts and passwords in your organization.
  > - If you are using CSV files from your existing production environment, see the detailed instructions in step 5 in the next section.

  To learn more about the CSV files that are required and the info you need to include in each file, see <a href="https://aka.ms/sdscsvattributes" target="_blank">CSV files for School Data Sync</a>. If you run into any issues, see <a href="https://aka.ms/sdserrors" target="_blank">School Data Sync errors and troubleshooting</a>.

**<a name="usesdstoimportdata"></a>Turn on Classroom and use SDS to import data**

1. Go to the <a href="http://sds.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft School Data Sync site</a>.
2. Click **Sign in**. You will see the **Settings** option for **Manage School Data Sync and Classroom**.

  **Figure 5** - Settings for managing SDS and Classroom

  ![Settings for managing SDS and Classroom](images/sds_sds_and_classroom_off.png)

3. Turn on **School Data Sync**. You will get a notification that it is turned on. Click **OK**.

  New menu options will appear on the left of the SDS portal.

  **Figure 6** - New menu options appear after SDS is turned on

  ![New menu options appear after SDS is turned on](images/sds_sds_on_newmenu_items.png)

4. Turn on **Microsoft Classroom**. You will get a notification that Classroom is turned on.
5. Click **+ Add Profile** from the sync dashboard or from the menu on the left to start syncing school data.

  This opens up the new profile setup wizard within the main page.

  **Figure 7** - New SDS profile setup wizard

  ![New SDS profile setup wizard](images/sds_updated_addnewprofile.png)

6. For the new profile, in the **Before you begin...** screen:
  1. Enter a name for your profile, such as *ContosoAcademySDSProfile*.
  2. Select a sync method for your profile. For this walkthrough, select **CSV Files**.

    Note that for any sync method that you choose, you can click the **View steps** link to get more information about the steps you need to take depending on the sync method of your choosing.
    
  3. Click **Start**.

    **Figure 8** - Add a name and sync method for the new profile

    ![Add a name and sync method for the new profile](images/sds_updated_newprofile_name_syncmethod.png)


7. In the **Sync options** screen:
  1. Select the domain for the schools/sections. If you have more than one domain, make sure you select the domain that corresponds to the profile you're creating.
  2. In the **Select school and section properties** section, select the properties you want to sync. If you select additional properties, make sure you have these properties and values added in the CSV files. For the walkthrough, we're not changing the default values. These are:
    - **School properties:** SIS ID, Name
    - **Section properties:** SIS ID, School SIS ID, Section Name
  3. In the **Select new or existing users** section, select either **New Users** or **Existing Users** based on the scenaro that applies to you.
    - Choose **New Users** if this is a brand new tenant and this is the first time that you're adding users.

        Choose the **New Users** option if you are using an unaltered version of the sample CSV files from [Download sample school data](#downloadcsvsamples) or if you created your own CSV files with new users.

    - Choose **Existing Users** if you already have a live production tenant, with teachers and students that already have active accounts in Office 365 (cloud only or synced from on-premise Active Directory).

        Using the **Existing Users** option, SDS will not attempt to create new users. Instead, it uses the identity matching options in the next section of the setup wizard to match the students and teachers in your CSV files to the user accounts that already exist in Azure. All additiional details for the students and teachers contained within the CSV files will be written as extension attributes on top of the already existing user objects. You can find more information about these settings on the main SDS deployment page for CSV-based deployments in <a href="http://aka.ms/sdscsv" target="_blank">How to deploy School Data Sync by using CSV files</a>.

  4. In the **Sync option for Section Group Display Name**, check the box if you want to allow teachers to overwrite the section names.
  5. In the **License Options** section, check the box to **Assign Microsoft Classroom licenses to teachers and students**.
  6. Click **Next**.

  2. In the **Select student properties** section, you can add optional student properties to sync. For this walkthrough, you don't have to change the default.
  3. In the **Student licenses** section, choose the SKU to assign licenses for students. For this walkthrough, choose **STANDARDWOFFPACK_STUDENT**.
  4. Click **Next**.

    **Figure 11** - Specify options for student mapping

    ![Specify options for student mapping](images/sds_updated_newprofile_studentmapping_updated.png)

10. You will see a page for your profile. The status might indicate that it's still being set up. 

  In the profile **Review** page, review the summary and confirm that the values matches with the data you entered. 

    **Figure 12** - Review the summary and confirm that it matches with the data you entered.

    ![Review the summary and confirm that it matches with the data you entered](images/sds_updated_newprofile_summary.png)

11. After the profile name at the top, confirm that the status for your profile now says **Ready to sync**.

  **Figure 13** - New profile is ready to sync

  ![Confirm that the new profile is ready](images/sds_updated_newprofile_status_readytosync.png)

11. On the profile page, below the profile name and profile status, there are four options: **Upload Files**, **Start Sync**, **Edit**, and **Delete**. Click **Upload Files** and then follow these steps:
  1. In the **Select data files to be uploaded** window, click **Add Files** and navigate to the directory where you saved the six CSV files required for data import.
  2. In the File Explorer window, choose all the files at the same time and then click **Open**.

  4. After all the files are successfully uploaded, click **OK**.
12. On the profile page, click **Start Sync** and then follow these steps:
  1. In the **Would you like to start sync for *Profile_Name?*** window, click **Start Sync**. *Profile_Name* should match the name you entered for your profile in the **Before you begin...** screen.
  2. Confirm that sync successfully started for the file and then click **OK**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Sync times, like file download times, can vary widely depending on when you start the sync, how much data you are syncing, the complexity of your data (such as the number of users, schools, and class enrollments), overall system/network load, and other factors. Two people who start a sync at the same time may not have their syncs complete at the same time.
  >
  > You can refresh the page to confirm that your profile synced successfully.

That's it for school data. Next, we'll configure Store for Business.

### 1.3 Configure Store for Business for app distribution
You'll need to configure Store for Business to accept the EULA and associate your Store account with Intune for Education by selecting Intune as the management tool for distributing apps.

**Associate your Store account with Intune for Education**
1. Sign into <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/business-store" target="_blank">Store for Business</a>.
2. Accept the Store for Business Services Agreement. This will take you to the Store portal.

  4. Select the app you want to install.
  5. In the app's Store page, select the license type and then select **Get the app**.
  6. You should see a dialog that confirms your order. Click **Close**.
  7. In the app's Store page, select **Add to private store**.
  8. Repeat steps 3-7 to install another app.
  9. In the Store for Business portal, select **Manage > Inventory** and verify that the apps you purchased appear in your inventory.

    For example, if you bought Duolingo and Khan Academy, they will show up in your inventory along with the apps that Microsoft automatically provisioned for your education tenant.

    **Figure 27** - Apps inventory in Store for Business

    ![Apps inventory in Store for Business](images/wsfb_manage_inventory_annotated.png)

    In the **Private store** column of the **Inventory** page, the status for some apps will indicate that it's "In private store" while others will say "Not in private store". We won't go over this in the walkthrough, but you can learn more about this in [Distribute apps using your private store](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/windows/manage/distribute-apps-from-your-private-store).

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You'll see in the above screenshot that some apps say that add is in progress. Sync happens automatically, but it may take up to 24 hours for your organization's private store and 12 hours for Intune for Education to sync all your purchased apps. Let's force a sync to make this process happen faster. 

**Install apps for all users**

Now that you've bought the apps, use Intune for Education to specify the group to install the apps for. Here, we'll show you how to install the apps you bought for all devices used by all users in your tenant. 

1. In the <a href="https://intuneeducation.portal.azure.com/" target="_blank">Intune for Education console</a>, click the **Groups** option from the menu on the left.

You're now done assigning apps to all users in your tenant. It's time to set up your Windows device(s) and check that your cloud infrastructure is correctly set up and your apps are being pushed to your devices from the cloud.

## 3. Set up your Windows devices

### 3.1 Set up devices using Set up School PCs or Windows OOBE
We recommend using the latest build of Windows 10 Creators Update (version 1703) on your Windows education devices. If you haven't done so already, [download and install the latest Windows 10 Creators Update image](#download-and-install-the-latest-windows-10-creators-update-image).

To set up new Windows devices and enroll them to your education tenant, choose from one of these options:
- **Option 1: [Use the Set up School PCs app](#usesetupschoolpcs)** - You can use the app to create a setup file that you can use to set up your Windows 10 devices.
- **Option 2: [Go through Windows OOBE and join the device to Azure AD](#usewindowsoobandjoinaad)** - You can go through a typical Windows device setup or first-run experience to configure your device.

**<a name="usesetupschoolpcs"></a>Option 1: Set up a device using the Set up School PCs app**

  > [!NOTE]  
  > The Set up School PCs app is coming soon! Until it's ready, follow the steps in this section to install a setup file (provisioning package) that we created for you. You still have to go through OOBE to join Wi-Fi and Azure AD, but you won't need these steps when the Set up School PCs app is available.

**Prerequisite:** 
- Copy the latest version of the education provisioning package file, **SetupSchoolPC.ppkg**, from the <a href="https://www.yammer.com/wsscengineering/#/groups/10257877/files" target="_blank">Microsoft Education System TAP Yammer group</a> to a USB key.

1. Boot up a new or reset Windows 10 device.
2. During Windows setup, at the **Let's start with region** screen, insert the USB key into your Windows device.
3. When the **You can eject your removable device** message appears on the screen, remove the USB key.
4. Complete the rest of the Windows device setup experience.
5. If you don't have a Wi-Fi network configured, make sure you connect the device to the Internet through a wired/Ethernet connection.
6. On the **Let's get you signed in** screen, enter one of the accounts that you set up for your education tenant.
7. Complete the rest of device setup and then reboot the device.

> [!NOTE]
> **The following section on using the Set up School PCs app is preliminary and subject to change. The steps are based on a preliminary build of the app, which is still in development.**

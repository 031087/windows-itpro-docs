## Follow the step-by-step guide

1. If you don't have a Wi-Fi network configured, make sure you connect the device to the Internet through a wired or Ethernet connection.
2. Go through the Windows device setup experience. On a new or reset device, this starts with the **Let's start with region. Is this right?** screen.

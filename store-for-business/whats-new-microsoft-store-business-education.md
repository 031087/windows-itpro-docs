| ![License assign icon](images/license-assign-icon.png) |**Assign apps to larger groups**<br /><br /> We're making it easier for admins to assign apps to groups of people. Admins can assign licenses to groups of any size, and include subgroups within those groups. We’ll figure out who’s in those groups, and assign licenses to people in the groups (skipping people who already have licenses). Along the way, we’ll let you know how many licenses are needed, and provide an estimate on the time required to assign licenses.<br /><br />**Applies to**:<br /> Microsoft Store for Business <br /> Microsoft Store for Education |
| ![Private store icon](images/private-store-icon.png) |**Change collection order in private store**<br /><br /> Private store collections make it easy for groups of people to find the apps that they need. Now, you can customize the order of your private store collections. <br /><br />**Applies to**:<br /> Microsoft Store for Business <br /> Microsoft Store for Education |
| ![Office logo icon](images/office-logo.png) |**Office 365 subscription management**<br /><br /> We know that sometimes customers need to cancel subscription. While we don't want to lose a customer, we want the process for managing subscriptions to be easy. Now, you can delete your Office 365 subscription without calling Support. From Microsoft Store for Business and Education, you can request to delete an Office 365 subscription. We'll wait three days before permanently deleting the subscription. In case of a mistake, customers are welcome to reactivate subscriptions during the three-day period. <br /><br />**Applies to**:<br /> Microsoft Store for Business <br /> Microsoft Store for Education |

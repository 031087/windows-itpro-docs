# Contributing to Windows IT professional documentation

Thank you for your interest in the Windows IT professional documentation! We appreciate your feedback, edits, and additions to our docs.
This page covers the basic steps for contributing to our technical documentation.

## Sign a CLA

All contributors who are ***not*** a Microsoft employee must [sign a Microsoft Contribution Licensing Agreement (CLA)](https://cla.microsoft.com/) before contributing to any Microsoft repositories. 
If you've already contributed to Microsoft repositories in the past, congratulations! 
You've already completed this step.

## Editing topics

We've tried to make editing an existing file as simple as possible. 

- If you're already in the repo, just navigate to the file you want to make the edits to and click the **Edit** button.  
- Alternatively, if you're viewing a TechNet page in your browser, click the **Contribute** button on the top right of the page. You will be redirected to the relevant source file in the repo, where you can click the **Edit** button. 
 
When you're done, submit a pull request back to the master branch of the official repository. 

After you create the pull request, a member of the writing team will review your changes.

If your request is accepted, updates are published to one of the following places:

- [Windows 10](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows)
- [Internet Explorer 11](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/internet-explorer)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/microsoft-edge)
- [Surface](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/surface)
- [Surface Hub](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/surface-hub)
- [Windows 10 for Education](https://technet.microsoft.com/edu/windows)
- [Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/mdop) 

## Making more substantial changes

To make substantial changes to an existing article, add or change images, or contribute a new article, you will need to create a local clone of the content. 
For info about creating a fork or clone, see the GitHub help topic, [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

Fork the official repo into your personal GitHub account, and then clone the fork down to your local device.  Work locally, then push your changes back into your fork.  Then open a pull request back to the master branch of the official repo.

## Using issues to provide feedback on documentation

If you just want to provide feedback rather than directly modifying actual documentation pages, you can create an issue in the repository.

At the top of a topic page you'll see an **Issues** tab. Click the tab and then click the **New issue** button. 

Be sure to include the topic title and the URL for the page you're submitting the issue for, if that page is different from the page you launched the **New issue** dialog from.

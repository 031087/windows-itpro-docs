# What's new in Surface Hub 2S

Surface Hub 2S is an all-in-one collaboration canvas that’s built for teamwork delivering a digital whiteboard, meetings platform, and a Windows 10 computing experience in one device.

## Modular design

A key part of the design of Surface Hub 2 is that it’s built to be modular and easily updated when new features become available. With a removable processor cartridge on the back of the device, Surface Hub 2S is fully updatable to Surface Hub 2X simply by replacing the cartridge. For example, Surface Hub 2S already includes components and features supported in Surface Hub 2X, including the ability to tile multiple Surface Hubs together and rotate the device.

## UEFI management and recovery

Surface Hub 2S is fully integrated with Surface Enterprise Management Mode (SEMM), enabling IT administrators to manage hardware components and firmware at the firmware level. For example you can restrict boot options, disable the various radios in the system such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and lock down access to the UEFI menu. To learn more about the SEMM technology that’s shared across Surface products, see [Microsoft Surface Enterprise Management Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/surface/surface-enterprise-management-mode).

## Mobile and untethered

You can mount Surface Hub 2S with the optional [Steelcase Roam Mobile Stand](https://www.steelcase.com/products/collaboration/steelcase-roam/) making it easy to move the device between conference rooms, huddle spaces, or wherever you need it. An optional lithium-ion [APC Charge Mobile Battery](https://www.apc.com/us/en/campaign/apc-charge-mobile-battery-for-microsoft-surface-hub-2.jsp) provides power to the device wherever you are using it, providing enough battery power to support a typical meeting lasting an hour or more.

## Advanced display, camera, and audio

With Surface Hub 2S meetings sound and look crystal clear because of improved display, microphones, speakers, 4K camera, and integration with Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business.

- **Display:** A 50” 4K plus PixelSense anti-glare display with a 3:2 aspect ratio enables image clarity with high-quality pen and touch feel.
- **Camera:** The 4K camera delivers a 90-degree horizontal field of view designed to integrate natural colors and uniform lighting to enable a cognitively comfortable  meeting experience. It includes an internal lens rotation  mechanism that allows you to set up the field of view for either portrait or landscape. For accidental impacts to the camera, a breakaway foot and integrated tether provide resiliency and allow the camera to detach and bounce back without dropping to the floor.
- **Audio:** For enhanced audio clarity, even in noisy environments, sound is delivered using a pair of 2-way front facing, super wideband stereo speakers, and a discrete bass module that faithfully reproduce the human voice. An integrated 8-microphone full band array uses spatial filtering (more commonly known as beamforming) to focus on people speaking in front of the device and ignore sounds from the sides or back of the room. New capabilities such as smart voice automatic gain control further minimize background noise to improve voice clarity.

## Microsoft Teams

Calling and meeting capabilities support coexistence of cloud and on premises solutions with side-by-side compatibility with Skype for Business. Microsoft Teams for Surface Hub enables “one-touch join” and up to four incoming video streams.

## Microsoft Whiteboard

Microsoft Whiteboard on Surface Hub 2S gives you a persistent digital canvas with features such as intelligent ink, Active Directory integration on Surface Hub 2. and Bing search. Share the whiteboard across Windows, iOS, and Android devices and transform analog whiteboard images into digital ink, enabling them to blend as if it were originally created on Surface Hub.

## New licensing options

Take advantage of the [Microsoft Teams Meeting Room License](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Surface-IT-Pro-Blog/New-Office-365-licensing-options-for-Surface-Hub/ba-p/339238) available in Office 365. This license covers Skype for Business, Microsoft Teams, and Intune.

## On-screen display

Surface Hub 2S provides an on-screen display to configure additional settings.  

## New power settings

Like the original Surface Hub, when Surface Hub 2S detects that someone has entered the room, it wakes up and displays the Welcome screen. Surface Hub 2S now supports connected standby, the default power management state across Surface devices. It uses a Doppler sensor to trigger the sleep state when a room is empty or after a minute of no movement in the room or activity on the device.

## New Surface Hub pen

The new Surface Hub 2 pen includes a projective capacitance optically bonded sensor (PCOS) active pen technology that facilitates real-time writing without lag. The pen uses AAA batteries and comes with updatable firmware.

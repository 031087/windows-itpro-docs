# Install and mount Surface Hub 2S

## Certified Steelcase solution

You can mount Surface Hub 2S with the certified wall mount or the certified mobile stand, both developed in partnership with Steelcase. Both fully integrate with the design of Surface Hub 2S, enabling unimpeded access to the compute cartridge along with all I/O ports and power. For more information, see [Steelcase Roam specifications](https://www.steelcase.com/content/uploads/2019/05/Steelcase-Roam-Spec-Guide.pdf).

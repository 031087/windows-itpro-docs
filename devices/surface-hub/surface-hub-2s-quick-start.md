# Surface Hub 2S quick start 



## Unpack Surface Hub 2S
1. Use the handles on each side of the box to move it to the space where you'll set it up.
2. Before opening, remove the clips (4) located on the front and back, and then lift the top off the box using the handles.
3. In the base of the Surface Hub 2S, open the accessories box containing the setup guide, Surface Hub 2 pen, Surface Hub 2 camera and the power cable.
4. On the back of the Surface Hub there's an instructional label showing you where to attach the mounting hardware. Install them in place and remove the label.

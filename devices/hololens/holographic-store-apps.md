# Find, Install, and Uninstall applications from the Microsoft Store

The Microsoft Store is your go-to source for apps and games that work with HoloLens. When you go to the Store on your HoloLens, any apps you see there will run on it.

Apps on HoloLens use either 2D view or holographic view. Apps with 2D view look like windows and can be positioned all around you. Apps that use holographic view surround you and become the only app you see.

HoloLens supports many existing applications from the Microsoft Store, as well as new apps built specifically for HoloLens.  This article will focus on holographic applications from the Microsoft store, read [custom holographic applications](holographic-custom-apps.md) to learn more about installing and running custom apps.

## Find apps

Open the Microsoft Store from the Start menu. Then browse for apps and games (or use your voice to searchâ€‹), select the microphone on the HoloLens keyboard, and start talking.

## Install apps

To download apps, you'll need to be signed in with a Microsoft account. To buy them, you'll need a payment method associated with the Microsoft account you use on your HoloLens. To set up a payment method, go to [account.microsoft.com](http://account.microsoft.com/) and select **Payment & billing** > **Payment options** > **Add a payment option**.

1. Perform a [bloom](hololens1-basic-usage.md) gesture to open the [**Start** menu](holographic-home.md).
2. Select the Store app and then tap to place this tile into your world.
3. Once the Store app opens, use the search bar to look for any desired application.
4. Select **Get** or **Install** on the application's page (a purchase may be required).

## Uninstall apps

There are two ways to uninstall applications.  You can uninstall applications through the Microsoft Store or Start menu.

### Uninstall from the Start menu

On **Start** or in the **All apps** list, gaze at the app. Tap and hold until the menu appears, then select **Uninstall**.

### Uninstall from the Microsoft Store

Open the Microsoft Store from the Start menu. Then browse for the application you'd like to uninstall.  There will be an **uninstall** button on the store page for applications you have installed.

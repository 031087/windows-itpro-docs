# Changing language or keyboard

HoloLens is configured for a language and region during set up. You can change the configuration under the “Time & language” section of  Settings app. 

## To change the Windows display language

1. Go to the **Start** menu, and then select **Settings** > **Time and Language** > **Language**.
2. Choose a language from the **Windows display language** menu. 

If the supported language you’re looking for is not in the menu, use the **Add a language button** in the **Preferred languages** section on the page to search for and add the language, then check in the **Windows display language menu** again.

Changing the Windows display language will:

- Change the UI text language for Windows and apps (for apps that support localization).
- Change the supported speech language for speech features in Windows and apps.
- Add the default keyboard layout for the language.

## To change the keyboard layout

To add or remove a keyboard layout, go to **Start menu** > **Settings** > **Time & language** > **Keyboard**.

When there is more than one keyboard layout added, you can switch between different keyboard layouts using the **Layout** key in the lower right corner of the on-screen keyboard.

> [!NOTE]
> While you can use the on-screen keyboard to enter text that requires Input Method Editor (IME) such as Chinese, using a Bluetooth hardware keyboard with IME is not currently supported. When a on-screen keyboard layout uses IME, you can continue to use a Bluetooth keyboard to type in English. To toggle a hardware keyboard to type in English, press the ~ key.

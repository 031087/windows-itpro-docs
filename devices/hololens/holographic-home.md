# Navigate the mixed reality home

Just like the Windows PC experience starts with the desktop, Windows Mixed Reality starts with mixed reality home. With HoloLens, your home is your physical space.  It is where you’ll use the Start menu to open and place apps and content.

## Use the Start menu

The **Start** menu on HoloLens is where you'll open apps and get to the HoloLens camera.

Wherever you are in HoloLens, you can always open the **Start** menu by using Start gesture.  On HoloLens (1st gen) the Start gesture is [bloom](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12644/hololens-use-gestures). On HoloLens 2, the [Start gesture](hololens2-basic-usage.md#navigate-windows-holographic) is to tap the Start icon that appears on your wrist.

> [!TIP]
> When the **Start** menu is open, use the start gesture to close it.

At the top of the **Start** menu, you'll see status indicators for Wi-Fi, battery, and volume, plus a clock. On HoloLens 2 there is also an additional speech listening indicator that shows when the device is speech enabled and listening for voice commands. At the bottom you'll find the photo and video buttons, which allows you to take photos and video recordings.  There is also a connect button that allows you to project what you see to another device via Miracast.

### Find apps on Start menu

The Start menu has a **Pinned apps** list and an **All apps** list.

- The **Pinned apps** list shows apps that have been pinned. You can add and remove apps from the **Pinned apps** list using the context menu that appears when you **select and hold** on an app tile.

- The **All apps** list shows all apps that are installed on the device.  Select the **All apps** button on the right side of the **Start** menu to get to the list. 

On both lists, use the **Page up** and **Page down** buttons to page through all the apps in the list.  Both app lists will automatically open to the page that was last used during a device session.

> [!TIP]
> On HoloLens 2, you can directly scroll the app lists using your index finger.

### Open apps from Start menu

To open an app from the **Start** menu, simply **select** an **app tile**. You can also say the name of an app to open it.

When you open an app from the Start menu, one of the following will happen, depending on how the app is designed:

- An **app window** is placed. The app is then loaded in the window and you will use the app directly in the window.
- A 3D model is placed. The model is a **launcher** for an **immersive app**.  You need to **select** the model to launch the immersive app.
- An app window is placed. The window acts as a **launcher** for an immersive app which then launches automatically. 

## Use apps on HoloLens

Apps on HoloLens can use app window view or immersive view. An app using app window view simply shows its content inside a window. An app using immersive view takes you away from mixed realty home where it can then display its content in the physical environment all around you. 

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Up to three 2D app windows can be active at a time. You can open more, but only three will remain active.
> - Each open app can have one active window at a time, except Microsoft Edge, which can have up to three.
> - If you're having problems with apps, make sure there's enough light in your space, and walk around so HoloLens has a current scan. If you keep having trouble, see [HoloLens and holograms: FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13456/hololens-and-holograms-faq) for more info.

## Move, resize, and rotate apps

Moving and resizing apps on HoloLens works a bit differently than it does on a PC. Instead of dragging the app, you'll use your gaze, along with a [gesture](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12644/hololens-use-gestures) or the [clicker](hololens-clicker.md). You can also rotate an app window in 3D space.

> [!TIP]
> Rearrange apps using your voice&mdash;gaze at an app and say "Face me," "Bigger," or "Smaller." Or have Cortana move an app for you: say "Hey Cortana, move &lt;*app name*&gt; here."

### Move an app

Gaze at the app, and then do one of the following.

- Tap and hold to select the app. Move your hand to position the app, and raise your finger to place it.

- Select **Adjust**,&nbsp;tap and hold, and move your hand to position the app. Raise your finger to place it, then select **Done**.
- Select **Adjust**, click and hold the clicker, and move your hand to position the app. Release the clicker, then select **Done**.

> [!TIP]
> If you drop apps when you move them, make sure to keep your hand in the gesture frame by following it with your gaze.

### Resize an app

Gaze at the app,&nbsp;and then do one of the following.

- Gaze at a corner or edge of an app window, and tap and hold. Move your hand to change the app's size, and raise your finger when you're done.

- Select **Adjust**. Gaze at one of the blue squares at the corners of the app, tap and hold, then move your hand to resize the app. Raise your finger to release it, then select **Done**.
- Select **Adjust**. Gaze at one of the blue squares at the corners of the app, click and hold the clicker, then move your hand to resize the app. Release the clicker, then select **Done**.

> [!TIP]
> In Adjust mode, you can move or resize any hologram.

### Rotate an app

Gaze at the app, and tap and hold with both hands to select it. Rotate the app by keeping one hand steady and moving your other hand around it. When you're done, raise both index fingers.

## Close apps

To close an app that uses 2D view, gaze at it, then select **Close**.

To close an app that uses holographic view, use the bloom gesture to bring up the **Start** menu, then select the **Home** button.


## Pin apps

Keep your favorite apps handy by pinning them to **Start**. In the **All apps** list, gaze at an app to highlight it. Tap and hold until the menu appears, then select **Pin**. To unpin an app, gaze at the app on **Start**, then tap and hold and select **Unpin**.

## Help! I can’t place holograms on HoloLens

If you’re using HoloLens and having trouble placing holograms, here are some things to try:

- Make sure you’re in a well-lit room without a lot of direct sunlight.
- Stand 1 to 3 meters from where you’re trying to place the hologram.
- Don’t place holograms on black or reflective surfaces.
- Walk around so HoloLens can rescan your surroundings.

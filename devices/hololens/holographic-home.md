# Navigate the mixed reality home

Just like the Windows PC experience starts with the desktop, Windows Mixed Reality starts with mixed reality home. With HoloLens, your home is your physical space.  It is where you’ll use the Start menu to open and place apps and content.

## Use the Start menu

The **Start** menu on HoloLens is where you'll open apps and get to the HoloLens camera.

Wherever you are in HoloLens, you can always open the **Start** menu by using Start gesture.  On HoloLens (1st gen) the Start gesture is [bloom](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12644/hololens-use-gestures). On HoloLens 2, the [Start gesture](hololens2-basic-usage.md#navigate-windows-holographic) is to tap the Start icon that appears on your wrist. 

> [!TIP]
> When the **Start** menu is open, use the start gesture to close it.

At the top of the **Start** menu, you'll see status indicators for Wi-Fi, battery, and volume, plus a clock. On HoloLens 2 there is also an additional speech listening indicator that shows when the device is listening for voice commands. At the bottom you'll find the photo and video buttons, which allows you to take photos and video recordings.  There is also a connect button that allows you to project what you see to another device via Miracast.

### Find apps on Start menu

The **Start** menu has a **Pinned apps** list and an **All apps** list.

- The **All apps** list shows all apps that are installed on the device.  Select the **All apps** button on the right side of the **Start** menu to get to the list.

- The **Pinned apps** list shows apps that have been pinned. You can add and remove apps from the **Pinned apps** list using the context menu that appears when you **select and hold** on an app tile.
 
> [!TIP]
> On HoloLens 2, you can directly scroll the Pinned apps list and All apps list using your index finger, in addition to using the Page up and Page down buttons.

### Open apps on Start menu

Select on an .

On **Start** or in the **All apps** list, select an app. It will open in a good position for viewing.

>[!NOTE]
>- Up to three 2D app windows can be active at a time. You can open more, but only three will remain active.
>- Each open app can have one active window at a time, except Microsoft Edge, which can have up to three.
>- If you're having problems with apps, make sure there's enough light in your space, and walk around so HoloLens has a current scan. If you keep having trouble, see [HoloLens and holograms: FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13456/hololens-and-holograms-faq) for more info.


## Use apps on HoloLens

Apps on HoloLens can use app window view or immersive view. An app using app window view looks like a window, and an app using immersive view surrounds you and become the only app you see.  When you open the Start Menu and you see a "Mixed reality home" button at the bottom, you are inside an immersive app view, and selecting the button will bring you back to mixed reality home.


## Move, resize, and rotate apps

Moving and resizing apps on HoloLens works a bit differently than it does on a PC. Instead of dragging the app, you'll use your gaze, along with a [gesture](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12644/hololens-use-gestures) or the [clicker](hololens-clicker.md). You can also rotate an app window in 3D space.

> [!TIP]
> Rearrange apps using your voice&mdash;gaze at an app and say "Face me," "Bigger," or "Smaller." Or have Cortana move an app for you: say "Hey Cortana, move &lt;*app name*&gt; here."

### Move an app

Gaze at the app, and then do one of the following.

- Tap and hold to select the app. Move your hand to position the app, and raise your finger to place it.

- Select **Adjust**,&nbsp;tap and hold, and move your hand to position the app. Raise your finger to place it, then select **Done**.
- Select **Adjust**, click and hold the clicker, and move your hand to position the app. Release the clicker, then select **Done**.

> [!TIP]
> If you drop apps when you move them, make sure to keep your hand in the gesture frame by following it with your gaze.

### Resize an app

Gaze at the app,&nbsp;and then do one of the following.

- Gaze at a corner or edge of an app window, and tap and hold. Move your hand to change the app's size, and raise your finger when you're done.

- Select **Adjust**. Gaze at one of the blue squares at the corners of the app, tap and hold, then move your hand to resize the app. Raise your finger to release it, then select **Done**.
- Select **Adjust**. Gaze at one of the blue squares at the corners of the app, click and hold the clicker, then move your hand to resize the app. Release the clicker, then select **Done**.

> [!TIP]
> In Adjust mode, you can move or resize any hologram.

### Rotate an app

Gaze at the app, and tap and hold with both hands to select it. Rotate the app by keeping one hand steady and moving your other hand around it. When you're done, raise both index fingers.

## Close apps

To close an app that uses 2D view, gaze at it, then select **Close**.

To close an app that uses holographic view, use the bloom gesture to leave holographic view, then select **Close**.

## Pin apps

Keep your favorite apps handy by pinning them to **Start**. In the **All apps** list, gaze at an app to highlight it. Tap and hold until the menu appears, then select **Pin**. To unpin an app, gaze at the app on **Start**, then tap and hold and select **Unpin**.

## Help! I can’t place holograms on HoloLens

If you’re using HoloLens and having trouble placing holograms, here are some things to try:

- Make sure you’re in a well-lit room without a lot of direct sunlight.
- Stand 1 to 3 meters from where you’re trying to place the hologram.
- Don’t place holograms on black or reflective surfaces.
- Walk around so HoloLens can rescan your surroundings.

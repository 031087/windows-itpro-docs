# Get ready to preview new modern workplace apps

Microsoft has just announced two new modern workplace apps coming to HoloLens: Remote Assist and Layout.

Soon, these apps will be available to download and deploy across your organization as part of a public preview. In the meantime, here's what you need to know to prepare for the public preview of each app, to make sure your app roll-out is smooth and seamless.

## Remote Assist

Remote Assist uses Microsoft Teams to facilitate two-way, real time, audio and video communication between a remote HoloLens user, and a user at a PC. The HoloLens user can project their view into Microsoft Teams, where the PC user can use inking annotations to mark it up with text and icons. The HoloLens user will see the inking appear within their device in real time.

## Layout

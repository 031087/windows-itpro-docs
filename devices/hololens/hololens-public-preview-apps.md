# Get ready to preview new modern workplace apps

Microsoft has just announced two new modern workplace apps coming to HoloLens: Remote Assist and Layout.

On May 22, 2018, these apps will be available to download and distribute across your organization as part of a public preview. In the meantime, here's what you need to know to prepare for the public preview of each app, to make sure your roll-out is smooth and seamless.

## Remote Assist

Remote Assist supports collaboration in mixed reality to solve problems faster. Firstline workers can collaborate remotely with heads-up, hands-free video calling, image sharing, and mixed reality annotations. They can share what they see with an expert, while staying hands-on to solve problems and complete tasks together, faster.

Here are the requirements you'll need to meet in order to distribute Remote Assist throughout your organization:

* **Windows 10 PC, iOS, and/or Android devices**: For communication with the HoloLens. The PC must have a minimum Windows OS version of {minimum required version here}.
* **HoloLens with RS4 build**: The HoloLens RS4 build will become publicly available at the same time as the modern workplace apps. There are two ways to ensure your HoloLens has the required build:
  * On May 22, update the HoloLens operating system. See [Manage updates to HoloLens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/HoloLens/hololens-updates) for instructions on using Windows Update for Business, MDM, and Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) to deploy updates to HoloLens.
  * Get started testing out the RS4 build in advance of May 22. See [HoloLens RS4 Preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/hololens-rs4-preview) for instructions on flashing the RS4 build to your device, and details on how the build will impact content stored on your HoloLens.
* **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**: Required for app distribution through the Microsoft Store for Business. See [Get started with Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/get-started-azure-ad) to learn more about Azure AD and licensing users.
* **Microsoft Teams**: Microsoft Teams is the backbone that facilitates communication in Remote Assist. All devices that will make calls to the HoloLens will need to have Microsoft Teams installed. See the [Overview of Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/teams-overview) to learn more.
* **Microsoft Office 365**: Because Microsoft Teams is part of Office 365, all users who will make calls from their PC/phone to the HoloLens will need an Office 365 license. See [Office 365 licensing for Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/office-365-licensing) to learn more.
* **Network requirements**: 1.5Mb/s is the bandwidth required to enable the full feature set. If your organization's bandwidth does not meet these requirements, you may notice HoloLens feature degradation, limiting the user experience. Please test your companyâ€™s network bandwidth by performing the following steps:
   1. Have a mobile Teams user (iOS or Android) video call a desktop Teams user.
   2. Once the video call has been successfully connected between user 1 and 2, add another separate video call between a 3rd and 4th user, and another for a 5th and 6th user.
   3. Continue adding video callers to stress test your network bandwidth until confident that multiple users can successfully connect on video calls at the same time.
   4. See [Preparing your organization's network for Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/prepare-network) to learn more.

## Layout

Layout enables users to design spaces in context with mixed reality. Bring designs from concept to completion with confidence and speed. Import 3D models to easily create and edit room layouts in real-world scale. Experience designs as high-quality holograms in physical space or in virtual reality and share and edit with stakeholders in real time.

Here are the requirements you'll need to meet in order to distribute Layout throughout your organization:

* **Windows 10 PC with Windows OS version {minimum required version here}**
* **HoloLens with RS4 build, or a Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset with motion controllers**:
  * If you're using a HoloLens, it must be running the RS4 build, which will be publicly released at the same time as the modern workplace apps. To ensure your HoloLens has the required build, you can either [Manage updates to HoloLens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/HoloLens/hololens-updates) on May 22 when the build is publicly available, or you can get started testing out the RS4 build in advance of May 22. See [HoloLens RS4 Preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/hololens-rs4-preview) for instructions on flashing the RS4 build to your device, and details on how the build will impact content stored on your HoloLens.
  * If you're using a Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset, your PCs will need to be able to support it. See [Windows Mixed Reality PC hardware guidelines](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4039260/windows-10-mixed-reality-pc-hardware-guidelines) for specific hardware requirements. We recommend following the **Windows Mixed Reality Ultra** hardware guidelines.
* **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**: Required for app distribution through the Microsoft Store for Business. See [Get started with Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/get-started-azure-ad) to learn more about Azure AD and licensing users.
* **Network requirements**: Internet access is required to download the app, and utilize all of its features. There are no bandwidth requirements.

<!--- * **Import Tool for Microsoft Layout**: This tool is a free companion app for Microsoft Layout that supports importing existing 3D models from a PC into Layout. It also enables users to share and edit the holograms in real time. The Import Tool for Microsoft Layout will be available to download on May 22nd, to align with the public preview of the modern workplace apps. --->

# Give us feedback

  |----------|----------|
  |  Apps  |  Issues with a specific application. |
  |  Developer  |  Issues in authoring / running an app for Mixed Reality. |
  |  Device  |  Issues with the HMD itself. |
  |  Home experience  |  Issues with your VR environment: interactions with the your mixed reality home. |
  |  Input  |  Issues with input methods: motion controllers, speech, gamepad, or mouse and keyboard. |

- To help us identify and fix the bug faster, capturing traces and video is extremely helpful. To start collecting traces, click on **Start capture**. This will begin collecting traces and a video capture of your mixed reality scenario.

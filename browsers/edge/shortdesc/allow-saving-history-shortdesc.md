By default, Microsoft Edge saves the browsing history of visited websites and shows them in the History pane. Disable this policy if you want Microsoft Edge to stop saving the browsing history.  If browsing history existed before disabling this policy, the previous browsing history remains in the History pane.  Disabling this policy does not stop roaming of existing browsing history or browsing history from other devices.

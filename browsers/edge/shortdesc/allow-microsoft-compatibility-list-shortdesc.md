By default, during navigation, Microsoft Edge checks the Microsoft Compatibility List for websites with known compatibility issues. If found, users are prompted to use Internet Explorer, where the site loads and displays properly. Periodically during browser navigation, Microsoft Edge downloads the latest version of the list and applies the updates.  You can view the compatibility list at about:compat.  Disable this policy to ignore the compatibility list.

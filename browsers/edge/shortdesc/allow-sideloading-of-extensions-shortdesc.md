By default, Microsoft Edge allows sideloading, which installs and runs unverified extensions.  Disabling this policy prevents sideloading of extensions but does not prevent sideloading using Add-AppxPackage via PowerShell.  You can only install extensions through Microsoft store (including a store for business), enterprise storefront (such as Company Portal) or PowerShell (using Add-AppxPackage).

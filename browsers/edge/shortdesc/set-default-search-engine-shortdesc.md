By default, Microsoft Edge uses the default search engine specified in App settings. In this case, users can make changes to the default search engine at any time unless the Allow search engine customization policy is disabled, which restricts users from making any changes.

Enabling this policy uses the policy-set search engine specified in the OpenSearch XML file, prevent users from changing the default search engine.

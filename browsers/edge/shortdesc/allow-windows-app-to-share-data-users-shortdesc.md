With this policy, you can configure Windows 10 to share application data among multiple users on the system and with other instances of that app.  Data is shared through the SharedLocal folder, which is available through the Windows.Storage API. If you previously enabled this policy and now want to disable it, any shared app data remains in the SharedLocal folder.

Microsoft Edge supports Adobe Flash as a built-in feature rather than as an external add-on and updates automatically via Windows Update. By default, Microsoft Edge prevents Adobe Flash content from loading automatically, requiring action from the user.  Depending on how often the content loads and runs, the sites for the content gets added to the auto-allowed list. Disable this policy if you want Adobe Flash content to load automatically.

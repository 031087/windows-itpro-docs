By default, Microsoft Edge shows the Address bar drop-down list and makes it available.  When enabled (default setting), this policy takes precedence over the [Configure search suggestions in Address bar](../available-policies.md#configure-search-suggestions-in-address-bar) policy. If you want to minimize network connections from Microsoft Edge to Microsoft service, we recommend disabling this policy, which hides the Address bar drop-down list functionality. When disabled, Microsoft Edge also disables the _Show search and site suggestions as I type_ toggle in Settings.

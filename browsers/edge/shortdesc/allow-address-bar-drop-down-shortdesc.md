Microsoft Edge shows the Address bar drop-down list and makes it available by default, which takes precedence over the [Configure search suggestions in Address bar](../available-policies.md#configure-search-suggestions-in-address-bar) policy. We recommend disabling this policy if you want to minimize network connections from Microsoft Edge to Microsoft service, which hides the functionality of the Address bar drop-down list. When you disable this policy, Microsoft Edge also disables the Show search and site suggestions as I type toggle in Settings.

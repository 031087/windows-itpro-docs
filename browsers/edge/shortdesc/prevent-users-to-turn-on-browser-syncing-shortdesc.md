This policy only works with the Do not sync browser policy, and for this policy to work correctly, you must enable the Do not sync browser policy. By default, browser settings sync automatically. Enabling this policy prevents syncing of browser settings and prevents users from turning on the Sync your Settings toggle in Settings.  If you want syncing turned off by default but not disabled, select the _Allow users to turn browser syncing_ option in the Do not sync browser policy.

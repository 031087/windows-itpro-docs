By default, Microsoft Edge pre-launches during Windows startup, when the system is idle, and each time Microsoft Edge closes. When Microsoft Edge pre-launches, it runs as a background process waiting to be launched by the user. Pre-launching helps the performance of Microsoft Edge and minimizes the amount of time required to start up Microsoft Edge. Disabling this policy prevents Microsoft Edge from pre-launching.

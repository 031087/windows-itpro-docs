By default, Microsoft Edge turns on the Sync your Settings toggle in Settings and let users choose what to sync on their device. Enabling this policy turns off and disables the Sync your Settings toggle in Settings, preventing syncing of userâ€™s settings between their devices. If you want syncing turned off by default in Microsoft Edge but not disabled, enable this policy and select the _Allow users to turn syncing on_ option in this policy.

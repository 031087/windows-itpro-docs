You can configure Microsoft Edge to store books from the Books Library to a default, shared folder in Windows, which decreases the amount of storage used by book files. When you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge downloads book files automatically to a common, shared folder, and prevents users from removing the book from the library. When disabled, Microsoft Edge does not use a shared folder but downloads book files to a folder for each user. For this policy to work properly, users must be signed in with a school or work account.

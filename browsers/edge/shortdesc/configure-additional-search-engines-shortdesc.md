By default, users cannot add, remove, or change any of the search engines in Microsoft Edge, but they can set a default search engine. However, with this policy, you can configure up to five additional search engines and set any one of them as the default. You set the default search engine using the [Set default search engine](../available-policies.md#set-default-search-engine) policy. If you enabled this policy and now want to disable it, disabling deletes all configured search engines.

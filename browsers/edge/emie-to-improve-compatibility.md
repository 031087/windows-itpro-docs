# Use Enterprise Mode to improve compatibility

> Applies to: WindowsÂ 10

If you have specific web sites and apps that have compatibility problems with Microsoft Edge, you can use the Enterprise Mode site list so that the web sites open in Internet Explorer 11 automatically. Additionally, if you know that your intranet sites aren't going to work properly with Microsoft Edge, you can set all intranet sites to automatically open using IE11 with the **Send all intranet sites to IE** group policy.

Using Enterprise Mode means that you can continue to use Microsoft Edge as your default browser, while also ensuring that your apps continue working on IE11.

## Enterprise guidance
Microsoft Edge is the default browser experience for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile. However, if you're running web apps that need ActiveX controls, we recommend that you continue to use Internet Explorer 11 for them. If you don't have IE11 installed anymore, you can download it from the Microsoft Store or from the [Internet Explorer 11 download page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=290956).

We also recommend that you upgrade to IE11 if you're running any earlier versions of Internet Explorer. IE11 is supported on Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10. So any legacy apps that work with IE11 will continue to work even as you migrate to Windows 10.

If you're having trouble deciding whether Microsoft Edge is good for your organization, you can take a look at this infographic about the potential impact of using Microsoft Edge in an organization.

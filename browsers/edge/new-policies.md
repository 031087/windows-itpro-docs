You can find the Microsoft Edge Group Policy settings in the following location of the Group Policy Editor:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Microsoft Edge\

In addition to the new group policies, we added a couple of new MDM policies to align with the existing group policies.

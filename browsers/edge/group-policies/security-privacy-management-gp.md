# Security and privacy management
>*Supported versions: Microsoft Edge on Windows 10*

Microsoft Edge helps to defend from increasingly sophisticated and prevalent web-based attacks against Windows.  While most websites are safe, some sites are malicious in nature, like stealing personal information or gain access to your system’s resources. By no longer supporting VBScript, JScript, VML, Browser Helper Objects, Toolbars, ActiveX controls, and Internet Explorer document modes, Microsoft Edge significantly reduces attacks making the browser more secure.

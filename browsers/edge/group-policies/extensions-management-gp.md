# Extensions settings

Currently, Microsoft Edge allows users to add or personalize, and uninstall extensions.  In the Windows 10, version 1810, you can configure Microsoft Edge to prevent users from uninstalling extensions.  You can also configure Microsoft Edge not to allow sideloading of extensions, which does not prevent sideloading using Add-AppxPackage via PowerShell. Allowing sideloading of extensions installs and runs unverified extensions.


## Allow Extensions 
[!INCLUDE [allow-extensions-include](../includes/allow-extensions-include.md)] 

## Allow sideloading of extensions 
[!INCLUDE [allow-sideloading-extensions-include](../includes/allow-sideloading-extensions-include.md)] 

## Prevent turning off required extensions 
[!INCLUDE [prevent-turning-off-required-extensions-include](../includes/prevent-turning-off-required-extensions-include.md)]

Microsoft Edge is the only app users can use on the device, preventing them from customizing Microsoft Edge.  Users can only browse publically or end their browsing session.<p>The single-app public browsing mode is the only kiosk mode that has an ‘End session’ button. Microsoft Edge also resets the session after a specified time of user inactivity. The reset after the idle timer is set to 5 minutes by default, but you can choose a value of your own in assigned access or set the value in the [ConfigureKioskResetAfterIdleTimeout](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-browser#browser-configurekioskresetafteridletimeout) policy. Both restart Microsoft Edge and clear the user’s session.<p>_**Example.**_ A public library or hotel concierge desk are two examples of public browsing that provides access to Microsoft Edge and other apps. <p>**Policy setting** = Enabled (1) |
| **Multi-app**<p>![Multi-app normal browsing experience](../images/Picture5-sm.png)<p>**Normal browsing**<p>Runs a full-version of Microsoft Edge with all browsing features and preserves the user data and state between sessions.<p>Some features may not work depending on what other apps you have configured in assigned access. For example, installing extensions or books from the Microsoft store are not allowed if the store is not available. Also, if Internet Explorer 11 is set up in assigned access, you can enable [EnterpriseModeSiteList](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-browser#browser-enterprisemodesitelist) to automatically switch users to Internet Explorer 11 for sites that need backward compatibility support.<p>**Policy setting** = Not configured (0 default)  | <p>&nbsp;<p>![Multi-app public browsing experience](../images/Picture6-sm.png)<p>**Public browsing**<p>Runs a multi-tab version of Microsoft Edge InPrivate with a tailored experience for kiosks that runs in full-screen mode. Users can open and close Microsoft Edge and launch other apps if allowed by assigned access. Instead of an End session button to clear their browsing session, the user closes Microsoft Edge normally.<p>In this configuration, Microsoft Edge can interact with other applications. For example, if Internet Explorer 11 is set up in multi-app assigned access, you can enable Enterprise Mode to automatically switch users to Internet Explorer 11 for sites that need backward compatibility support. For more details about running a multi-app kiosk, or fixed-purpose device, see [Create a Windows 10 kiosk that runs multiple apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/lock-down-windows-10-to-specific-apps).<p>_**Example.**_ A public library or hotel concierge desk are two examples of public browsing that provides access to Microsoft Edge and other apps.<p>**Policy setting** = Enabled (1)  |

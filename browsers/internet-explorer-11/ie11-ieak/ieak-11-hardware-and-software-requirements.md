# IEAK 11: Hardware and software requirements


Install Internet Explorer 11 before you try to use IEAK 11 and the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard 11. For more information about installing IE11, see [IEAK 11: Determine the licensing version and features to use](ieak-11-determine-the-licensing-version-and-features-to-use.md).

Before you start the IE Customization wizard, check how much disk space you have on the drive you’ll use to build the IE11 installation package. This drive can be on the same computer as the computer running the customization wizard; it just needs to have a secure destination folder.

Before you start to build your IE11 installation packages, you need to meet all of the IE requirements, plus you need:

-   Up to 100 megabytes (MB) of disk space, depending on how many components you include in the installation package.

-   An additional 100 MB of disk space for each custom installation package built. Different media types are considered separate packages.

-   Make sure that the computer you’re using to build your installation packages includes IE11 and is running one of these operating systems:

    -   Windows 10

        However, only the "Configuration-only package" is available, and you must use the Windows 8.1 target platform.

    -   Windows 8.1

    -   Windows Server 2012 R2

    -   Windows® 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1)

    -   Windows Server 2008 R2 (SP1)

-   Make sure that the computer you’re using to run IEAK 11 is using the same version of the operating system as the computer where you’ll build your installation packages.

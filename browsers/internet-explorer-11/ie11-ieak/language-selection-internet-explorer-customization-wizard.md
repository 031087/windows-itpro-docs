# Language Selection: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard


The **Language Selection** page of the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard 11 lets you choose the language for your IE Administration Kit 10 (IEAK 10) custom package. You can create custom Internet Explorer 11 packages in any of the languages your operating system version is available in.

**Important**  
Make sure that the language of your IEAK 11 matches the language of your custom IE package. If the languages don’t match, IEAK 11 won’t work properly.

1.  Pick the language you want your custom IE11 installation package to use.

    You can support as many languages as you want, but each localized version must be in its own installation package.

    **Note**  
    To keep your settings across multiple versions of the package, you can pick the same destination folder for all versions. The different language versions are then saved in separate subfolders within that destination folder. Like, for an English version, `C:\Cie\Build1\Flat\Win32_WIN8\en-US\` and for a German version, `C:\Cie\Build1\Flat\Win32_WIN8\de-DE\`.

     

2.  Click **Next** to go to the [Package Type Selection: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard](package-type-selection-internet-explorer-customization-wizard.md) page or **Back** to go to the [Platform Selection: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard](platform-selection-internet-explorer-customization-wizard.md).

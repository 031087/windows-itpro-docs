# Important URLs - Home Page and Support: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard


The **Important URLS – Home Page and Support** page of the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard 11 lets you choose one or more **Home** pages and an online support page for your customized version of IE.

![](../common/wedge.gif)**To use the Important URLS – Home Page and Support page**

1.  In the **Add a homepage URL** box, type the URL to the page your employees go to when they click the **Home** button, and then click **Add**.

    If you add multiple **Home** pages, each page appears on a separate tab in the browser. If you don’t add a custom **Home** page, IE uses http://www.msn.com by default. If you want to delete an existing page, click the URL and then click **Remove**.

2.  Check the **Retain previous Home Page (Upgrade)** box if you have employees with previous versions of IE, who need to keep their **Home** page settings when the browser is updated.

3.  Check the **Online support page URL** box to type in the URL to your own support page. Customizing the support page is only supported in Internet Explorer for the desktop.

4.  Click **Next** to go to the [Accelerators: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard](accelerators-internet-explorer-customization-wizard.md) page or **Back** to go to the [Search Providers: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard](search-providers-internet-explorer-customization-wizard.md).

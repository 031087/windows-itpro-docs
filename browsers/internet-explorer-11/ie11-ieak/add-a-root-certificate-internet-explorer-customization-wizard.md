# Add a Root Certificate: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard


We’re sorry. While we continue to recommend that you digitally sign your package, we’ve removed all of the functionality that allowed you to add a root certificate using the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard 11. The wizard page itself will be removed in a future version of the IEAK.

Click **Next** to go to the [Programs: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard](programs_internet_explorer_customization_wizard.htm) page or **Back** to go to the [Security and Privacy Settings: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard](security_and_privacy_settings_internet_explorer_customization_wizard.md).

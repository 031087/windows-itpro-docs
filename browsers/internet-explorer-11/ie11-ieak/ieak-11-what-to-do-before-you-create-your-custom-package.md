# IEAK 11: What to do before you create your custom package


Go through this list, making sure you’ve answered all of the questions before you run Internet Explorer Administration Kit 11 (IEAK 11) and the IE Customization Wizard 11.

-   Have you determined which version of IE Administration Kit 11 (IEAK 11) to install? See [IEAK 11: Determine the licensing version and features to use](ieak-11-determine-the-licensing-version-and-features-to-use.md).

-   Do you meet the necessary hardware and software requirements? See [IEAK 11: Hardware and software requirements](ieak-11-hardware-and-software-requirements.md).

-   Have you gotten all of the URLs you’ll need so you can customize your **Home**, **Search**, and **Support** pages? See [Important URLs - Home Page and Support: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard](important-urls---home-page-and-support-internet-explorer-customization-wizard.md).

-   Have you reviewed the security features, determining how you want to set up and manage them? See [IEAK 11 and security](ieak-11-and-security.md).

-   Have you created a test lab, where you can run the test version of your browser package to make sure it runs properly?

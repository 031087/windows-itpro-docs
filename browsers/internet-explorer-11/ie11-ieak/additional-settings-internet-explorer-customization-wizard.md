# Additional Settings: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard


The **Additional Settings** page of the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard 11 lets you pick additional custom, corporate, and Internet settings that relate to your employee’s desktop, operating system, and security. If you don’t change a setting, it’ll be ignored.

The additional settings appear in administration (.adm) files that are stored in your &lt;*systemdrive*&gt;:\\Program Files\\Windows IEAK 11\\policies folder. You can also create your own .adm files with options that can be configured using the wizard. Any edits you make to your own .adm file are stored as .ins files, which are used to build the .inf files for your custom install package.

You can store your user settings in a central location so your employees that log on from computer to computer can use them. For example if you have an employee that requires low security using a computer that’s typically operated by someone that needs more restrictive permissions.

You’ll only see this page if you are running the **Internal** version of the IE Customization Wizard 11.

# Browsing Options: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard


The **Browsing Options** page of the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard 11 lets you decide how you want to manage the items in the **Favorites, Favorites Bar, and Feeds** section, including the Microsoft-provided default items.

The choices that you make on this page affect only the items shown on the **Favorites, Favorites Bar, and Feeds** page.

![](../common/wedge.gif)**To use the Browsing Options page**

1.  Pick how you want to manage links that are already installed on your employee’s computer:

    -   **Delete all existing items under Favorites, Favorites Bar and Feeds.** Removes all of the links, Web Slices, feeds, and Accelerators on the computer. This includes links and favorites added by you or the employee. Because this removes everything, we recommend that you use this option with caution.

    -   **Only delete the items created by the administrator.** Removes only the items that you added for your employees on the **Favorites, Favorites Bar and Feeds** page.

    -   **Don’t delete any items.** Doesn’t remove anything. Links Web Slices, feeds, and Accelerators are added to your employee computers at the top of the list, in the order you picked on the **Favorites, Favorites Bar and Feeds** page.

2.  Pick if you don’t want to add the Microsoft-default items:

    -   **Favorites.** Checking this box won’t add the Microsoft-defined links.

    -   **Web Slices and Links.** Checking this box won’t add the Microsoft-defined Web Slices or links.

    -   **Feeds.** Checking this box won’t add the Microsoft-defined RSS feeds.

    -   **Accelerators.** Checking this box won’t add the Microsoft-defined Accelerators.

3.  Click **Next** to go to the [First Run Wizard and Welcome Page Options: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard](first_run_wizard_and_welcome_page_options_internet_explorer_customization_wizard.htm) page or **Back** to go to the [Favorites, Favorites Bar, and Feeds: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard](favorites_favorites_bar_and_feeds_internet_explorer_customization_wizard.md) page.

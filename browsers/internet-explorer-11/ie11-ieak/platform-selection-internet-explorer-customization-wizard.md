# Platform Selection: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard


The **Platform Selection** page of the Internet Explorer Customization Wizard 11 lets you choose the operating system and processor type (32 or 64 bit) for the computers you’re going to install the custom installation package on.

![](../common/wedge.gif)**To use the Platform Selection page**

1.  Pick the operating system and architecture for the computers that you’re going to install the custom package on.

    You must create individual packages for each supported operating system.

    **Note**  
    To keep your settings across several operating system packages, you can specify the same destination folder. Then, after running the wizard, you can reuse the resulting .ins file. Any additional changes to the .ins file are saved.

     

    For more information about using .ins files, see [Using Internet Settings (.INS) Files](using_internet_settings__ins__files.htm). For more information about adding in your .ins file, see [File Locations: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard](file_locations_internet_explorer_customization_wizard.md).

2.  Click **Next** to go to the [Language Selection: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard](language_selection_internet_explorer_customization_wizard.htm) page or **Back** to go to the [File Locations: Internet Explorer Customization Wizard](file_locations_internet_explorer_customization_wizard.md).

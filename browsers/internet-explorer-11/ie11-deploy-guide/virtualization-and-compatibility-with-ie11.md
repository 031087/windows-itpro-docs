# Virtualization and compatibility with Internet Explorer 11


If your company is considering upgrading to the latest version of Internet Explorer, but is hesitant because of a large number of web apps that need to be tested and moved, we recommend that you consider virtualization. Virtualization lets you set up a virtual environment where you can run earlier versions of IE.

**Important**  
We strongly suggest that while you're using virtualization, you also update your web apps so they run natively in the newer version of IE. For more information about how to update your code, see the [Internet Explorer 11 Compatibility Cookbook (Windows)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=279707) to learn about the developer features that have been changed or deprecated since Internet Explorer 10.

 

The Microsoft-supported options for virtualizing web apps are:

-   **Microsoft Enterprise Desktop Virtualization (MED-V).** Uses Microsoft Virtual PC to provide an enterprise solution for desktop virtualization. With MED-V, you can easily create, deliver, and manage corporate Virtual PC images on any Windows®-based desktop. For more information, see [MED-V](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=271653).

-   **Client Hyper-V.** Uses the same virtualization technology previously available in Windows Server, but now installed for Windows 8.1. For more information, see [Client Hyper-V](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=271654).

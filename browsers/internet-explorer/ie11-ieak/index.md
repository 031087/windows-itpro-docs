ISPs install IEAK using External mode (for Internet Explorer 10 or newer) or Internet Service Provider (ISP) mode (for Internet Explorer 9 or older).

### Internet content providers
IEAK helps ICPs customize the appearance of Internet Explorer and its Setup program, including letting you add your company name or specific wording to the Title bar, set up a customer support webpage, set up the user home page and search providers, add links to the Favorites and the Explorer bars, add optional components, web slices and accelerators, and determine which compatibility mode Internet Explorer should use.

ICPs install IEAK using External mode (for Internet Explorer 10 or newer) or Internet Content Provider (ICP) mode (for Internet Explorer 9 or older)

### Independent software vendors
IEAK helps ISVs distribute (and redistribute) a custom version of Internet Explorer that can include custom components, programs, and controls (like the web browser control) that you create for your users. ISVs can also determine home pages, search providers, and add websites to the Favorites bar.

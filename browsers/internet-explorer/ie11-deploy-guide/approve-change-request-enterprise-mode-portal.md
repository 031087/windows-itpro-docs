# Approve a change request using the Enterprise Mode Site List Portal

**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows 8.1
-   Windows 7
-   Windows Server 2012 R2
-   Windows Server 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1 (SP1)

After a change request is successfully submitted to the pre-defined Approver(s), employees granted the role of **App Manager** or **Group Head**, they must approve the changes.

## Approve a change request
The Approvers get an email stating that a Requester successfully opened, tested, and submitted the change request to the Approvers group. The Approvers can accept or reject a change request.

**To approve a change request**
1. The Approver(s) log onto the Enterprise Mode Site List Portal, **My Approvals** page.



## Next steps
After the Approvers approve the change request, it must be scheduled for inclusion in the production Enterprise Mode Site List. For the scheduling steps, see the [Schedule a production environment change using the Enterprise Mode Site List Portal](schedule-production-change-enterprise-mode-portal.md) topic.




Approving a change request
An e-mail will be sent to the list of approvers.
After signing in, the employee will land on the My approvals page, or can navigate to the page by clicking Approvals pending in the sidebar.
The employee can select individual ticket IDs and verify the information provided in the change request.
The employee can approve or reject the ticket.
An e-mail will be sent to the Requester, Approvers, and Administrators with the status of the ticket.
The employee can also view the status of other tickets in his/her group by clicking the In progress, Closed, and Rolled back links in the sidebar.

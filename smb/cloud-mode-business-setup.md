# Get started: Deploy and manage a full cloud IT solution for your business
**Applies to:**

-   WindowsÂ 10

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is placeholder content only. Everything is TBD.

In this walkthrough, we'll show you how to deploy and manage a full cloud IT solution for your business using Microsoft Azure AD, Intune, Office 365, and Windows. We'll show you the basics on how to:
- Acquire an Office 365 business domain
- Add Microsoft Intune and Azure Active Directory (AD) Premium licenses to your business tenant
- Set up Windows Store for Business and manage app deployment and sync with Intune
- Add users and groups in Azure AD and Intune
- Create policies and app deployment rules
- Log in as a user and start using the device

Go to the [Microsoft Education site](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education) to learn more about these products. See [How to buy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/buy-license/overview-of-how-to-buy/default.aspx?tabshow=schools) to learn about pricing and purchasing options for businesses.

## 1. Get ready
Here's a few things to keep in mind before you get started:
- You must own and have a registered education domain

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you are a participant in the MEs Demo, you can skip this part. You can set up your tenant and complete this walkthrough without having your own registered fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

- **TBD - what else?**

## 2. Set up your cloud infrastructure
To set up a cloud infrastructure for your organization, follow the steps in this section.

### 2.1 Set up Office 365 Education tenant
To set up your Office 365 Education tenant, see [Get Started with Office 365 Education](https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Get-started-with-Office-365-Education-AB02ABE5-A1EE-458C-B749-5B44416CCF14).

If this is the first time you're setting this up, you'll need to create an account and a user ID and password to use to sign into your account. Save your sign-in info so you can use it to sign into https://portal.office.com (the sign-in page).

After you've set up your account, log into the Office 365 admin center.

**Figure 1** - Office 365 admin center

### 2.7 Configure automatic MDM enrollment with Azure AD and Intune
Read [this blog post](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2015/08/14/windows-10-azure-ad-and-microsoft-intune-automatic-mdm-enrollment-powered-by-the-cloud/) to learn how you can combine login, Azure AD Join, and Intune MDM enrollment into an easy step so that you can bring your devices into a managed state that complies with the policies for your organization. We will use the blog post as our guide for this part of the walkthrough and we'll show how you can add new groups.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you are using the new Azure portal, you may need to use the old Azure portal to make the steps work as outlined in the blog post. To go to the old Azure portal, type https://manage.windowsazure.com/@yourdomain#Workspaces/All/dashboard in your web browser. Replace *yourdomain* with your own domain name, such as contososchool.org.

**To configure the directory**
1. If this is the first time you're setting up your directory, When you navigate to the **Azure Active Directory** node in the Azure management portal you will see a screen informing you that your directory is ready for use.

  **Figure 7** - Active Directory is ready to use
  ![Your directory is ready to use](images/azure_ad_portal_old_select_directory.png)

2. Select the domain you want to configure.

  **Figure 8** - Select the directory or domain you want to configure
  ![Navigate to the Azure Active Directory node](images/azure_ad_portal_old_select_domain.png)

**To create groups**
1. After you have selected the domain (such as Contoso), select the **Groups** tab. You should see a list of all the groups you created as part of the SDS setup.
2. Select **Add Group** to create a new group. In the following example, this group is called **All Students**.

  **Figure 9** - Add an all students group

  ![Create a group for all students](images/azure_ad_portal_old_new_group.png)

  After you create the new group, it will appear in the list of all groups.

3. In the **Groups** tab, select the arrow next to the **All Students** group to add all students as members of the group and then save your changes.

  **Figure 10** - Add group members
  ![Add members to the new group](images/azure_ad_portal_old_add_group_members.png)

4. Repeat steps 1-3 and create an **All Teachers** group that includes all teachers and an **All Global Admins** group that includes all global administrators.

**To enable automatic MDM enrollment**
1. Select the **Applications** tab and verify that you can see Microsoft Intune in the list of applications. Click the arrow next to **Microsoft Intune** to configure the application.

  **Figure 11** - Microsoft Intune should appear in the list of applications
  ![Verify that Microsoft Intune appears in the list](images/azure_ad_portal_old_select_apps.png)

2. In the Microsoft Intune configuration page, select **Configure** to start automatic MDM enrollment configuration with Intune.
3. In the **Configure** tab:
  - In the **properties** section, you should see a list of URLs for MDM discovery, MDM terms of use, and MDM compliance. The URLs are automatically configured for your Azure AD tenant so you don't need to change them.
  - In the **manage devices for these users** section, you can specify which users' devices should be managed by Intune.
    - **All** will enable all users' Windows 10 devices to be managed by Intune.
    - **Groups** let you select whether only users that belong to a specific group will have their devices managed by Intune.

  <!-- Choose **Groups**, then click the **Select Groups** option to open the **Add groups** window. The list of groups should include the groups that were created as part of the SDS setup as well as the all students group that you created. -->

    > [!NOTE]
    > In this step, you must choose the group that contains all the users in your organization as members. This is the **All** group.

4. After you've chosen how to manage devices for users, select **Save** to enable automatic MDM enrollment with Intune.

7. Click **Save Policy**.
8. On the **Deploy Policy** dialog box, select **Yes** to deploy the policy now.
9. On the **Management Deployment** dialog box, select the user group(s) or device group(s) that you want to apply the policy to. For example, select **All Students**.
10. Click **OK**.

**To turn off Windows Hello and PINs during device setup**
1. In the Intune admin console, select **Admin**.
2. Navigate to **Mobile Device Management > Windows > Windows Hello for Business**.
3. In the **Windows Hello for Business** page, select **Disable Windows Hello for Business on enrolled devices**.
4. Click **Save**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > This policy is a tenant-wide Intune setting. It disables Windows Hello and required PINs during setup for all enrolled devices in a tenant.

## 5. Add more devices and users
After your cloud infrastructure is set up and you have a device management strategy in place, you may need to add more devices or users and you want the same policies to apply to these new devices and users. In this section, we'll show you how to do this.

### 5.1 Connect other devices to your cloud infrastructure
Adding a new device to your cloud-based tenant is easy. For new devices, you can follow the steps in [3. Set up devices](#3-set-up-devices). For other devices, such as those personally-owned by teachers who need to connect to the school network to access work or school resources (BYOD), you can follow the steps in this section to get these devices connected.

  > [!NOTE]
  > These steps enable users to get access to the organization's resources, but it also gives the organization some control over the device.

**To connect a device to your work or school**
1. On your Windows device, go to **Settings > Accounts**.
2. Select **Work access** and then click **Add a work or school account** to add an Azure AD account to the device.
3. Enter the work credentials for the account to authenticate the user.
4. If it appears, accept the MDM terms prescribed by the organization to allow the device to be managed.
  Once this is done, the device should be registered in Azure AD and enrolled in MDM and the account should have access to the organization's resources.


### 5.2 Add a new user
You can add new users to your tenant simply by adding them to the Office 365 groups. Adding new users to Office 365 groups automatically adds them to the corresponding groups in Microsoft Intune.

See [Add users to Office 365](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-users-to-Office-365-for-business-435ccec3-09dd-4587-9ebd-2f3cad6bc2bc?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US&fromAR=1) to learn more. Once you're done adding new users, go to the Intune admin portal and verify that the same users were added to the Intune groups as well.
